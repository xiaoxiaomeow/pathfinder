    "text": "This spell creates a severe blast of air (approximately 50 mph) that originates from you, affecting all creatures in the burst.<br><br>A Tiny or smaller creature on the ground is knocked down and rolled 1d4×10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet. If flying, a Tiny or smaller creature is blown back 2d6×10 feet and takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting.<br><br>Small creatures are knocked prone by the force of the wind, or if flying are blown back 1d6×10 feet.<br><br>Medium creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind, or if flying are blown back 1d6×5 feet.<br><br>Large or larger creatures may move normally within a hurricane blast effect.<br><br><i>Hurricane blast<\/i> can’t move a creature beyond the limit of its range. Any creature, regardless of size, takes a –4 penalty on ranged attacks and Listen checks in the area of a <i>hurricane blast<\/i>. The force of the gust automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50% chance to extinguish those lights.<br><br>In addition to the effects noted, a hurricane blast can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or hangings, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range.",
