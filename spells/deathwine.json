    "text": "This spell allows you to turn a potion into a temporary pool of necromantic energy. Only a potion created using a conjuration (healing) spell can be affected by this spell. An affected potion turns dark red and reveals a necromantic aura if <i>detect magic<\/i> is cast on it while it remains under this spell’s effects.<br><br>When you drink a potion affected by this spell, you do not gain the potion’s normal effect. Instead, the first necromancy spell you cast within the next minute is cast at a higher caster level. The bonus to caster level is equal to the spell level of the spell used to create the potion that <i>deathwine<\/i> affects. For example, a 5th-level wizard who drinks <i>deathwine<\/i> made from a <i>potion of cure serious wounds<\/i> would cast his next necromancy spell as an 8th-level caster, as <i>cure serious wounds<\/i> is a 3rd-level spell.<br><br>In addition, any undead creature (or other creature healed by negative energy) that drinks a potion affected by <i>deathwine<\/i> is healed of 1d8 points of damage. Any potion not imbibed before this spell’s duration expires is destroyed at the end of the <i>deathwine’s<\/i> duration.",
