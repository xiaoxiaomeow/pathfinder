The figment hangs invisible and obscured upon the target surface for the duration of the spell. Another casting of <i>geomessage<\/i> is needed to cause the figment to arrange itself into the intended message.<br><br> When you cast the spell, you can choose to incorporate a passphrase into the spell. If you do so, the message is protected as if <i>nondetection<\/i> had been cast on it for the full duration of the spell, though creatures that cast <i>geomessage<\/i> on the surface and speak the passphrase ignore the <i>nondetection<\/i> effect and cause the image to become visible until the caster speaks the passphrase again.<br><br> Without a passphrase, the message simply remains invisible to those who cast <i>geomessage<\/i>. Detection methods like <i>detect magic<\/i> and <i>see invisibility<\/i> indicate the message’s presence but do not reveal its contents.",
