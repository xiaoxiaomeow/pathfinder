All items within the container when the spell was cast are still present, but they can’t be noticed unless removed from the bag—such as by someone who can perceive them, or who upends the container.<br><br> Casting <i>vacuous vessel<\/i> on another container or placing a new item in the existing container immediately dismisses the currently active spell.",
