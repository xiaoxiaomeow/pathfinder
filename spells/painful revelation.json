A successful Will save reduces the nonlethal damage by half and negates the staggered effect. Once <i>painful revelation<\/i> has been triggered, the spell ends.<br><br> However, creatures under the effect of spells such as <i>true seeing<\/i> that automatically pierce illusions are not subject to this effect.",
