    "text": "Hermea’s benevolent Council of Enlightenment uses this spell to humanely preserve their society’s greatest minds from the ravages of time, though it has seen far more sinister employment when put to use by other organizations that have since discovered its utility. This spell binds a single creature into a prepared book, sustaining it in suspended animation and filling the book with its experience and knowledge. The tome weighs 10 pounds and has one page for every day of the subject’s life. The cover and binding transform to reflect the subject’s appearance, interests, and tastes. Every thought and memory—including those the target may have forgotten long ago—are perfectly transcribed within the enchanted pages, penned in excruciating detail in the language that the creature was thinking or speaking in when the event occurred. If a memory includes dialogue in a language the subject didn’t understand, that dialogue is reproduced phonetically, and must be translated by a reader who knows that language. Any alterations to a subject’s memories—such as by a <i> modify memory spell <\/i>—appear in a subtly different script; a successful DC 35 Linguistics check is needed to identify this. <br><br> Spells that modify or remove text—such as <i> erase<\/i> or <i>secret page <\/i>—also affect the target’s memory if they persist after its release. <i> Modify memory <\/i> can be used to repair any changes to its original state, or alter the accounts recorded within the book. A creature imprisoned by scribe’s binding automatically fails any saving throws against effects to change or modify its memories. <br><br> A target bound by this spell can be freed by only <i> freedom <\/i>, <i> miracle <\/i>, or <i> wish <\/i>. Polymorph any object restores the target’s normal form for 24 hours. Scribe’s binding makes the imprisoning tome supernaturally durable (hardness 20, 10 hp per HD the imprisoned creature had). Destroying the tome immediately slays the creature imprisoned within.",

    "text_zh": "<p>赫迷亚（Hermea）中慈善的启迪议会（Council of Enlightenment）本着慈悲之心，使用这种法术来保护他们社会里最伟大的思想免于时间侵蚀，但这种法术在那些已经发现其用途的其他组织手里似乎变成了一件邪恶的工具。这种法术可以将一个生物送入一本准备好的书中，生物在书中会陷入假死，而他的经验和知识会被装入书中。卷册重达10磅，页数为目标已活的日数。封面和装订会发生变化以反映目标的外貌、兴趣、和口味。每一个想法和记忆——包括那些目标都已经遗忘很久的——都会被完美地撰写到附魔书页上，详细到每一个细节，用该生物遭遇此事时思考或说话所用的语言书写。如果记忆里包含有用目标不懂的语言所进行的对话，对话会按照发音被重现，必须被一个理解这门语言的阅读者翻译。任何对目标记忆的修改——例如通过修改记忆法术——会以一种略微不同的文本出现; 要识别它需要成功通过一次DC35的成功语言学检定。<\/p><p>修改或移除文本的法术——例如抹消术或秘密文页——同样会影响目标的记忆，如果这些改变在被释放后存留。修改记忆可以被用来修复任何改变，将其还原，或改变书里的记录内容。被困在书中的生物自动在所有对抗改变或修改记忆的豁免检定中失败。<\/p><p>被这个法术束缚的目标只能被行动自如、神迹术或祈愿术释放。变化万物可以在24小时内恢复目标的正常状态。抄写员之缚会让监禁别人的卷册变得超级耐久（硬度为20，10hp/囚禁生物的HD）。摧毁卷册会立即杀死囚禁在里面的生物。<\/p>"
