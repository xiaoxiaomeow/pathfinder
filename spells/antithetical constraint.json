For example, a lawful evil target would automatically fail at all attacks except those made against chaotic good creatures, and a neutral good target would automatically fail at all attacks except those made against neutral evil creatures. For the purposes of <i>antithetical constraint<\/i>, creatures that are chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful evil, or lawful good are all considered to have the opposite alignment of a target whose alignment is neutral with no other alignment components. This restriction doesn’t apply to effects that do not require attack rolls, such as <i>magic missile<\/i>.",
