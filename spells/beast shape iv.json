    "mythicText": "Each <i>mythic beast shape<\/i> spell must be learned individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic <i>beast shape<\/i> spell to learn its mythic version.

Each <i>mythic beast shape<\/i> spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version.<br><br> The spell’s bonuses to ability scores increase by 2, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the ability score penalties decrease by 2 (minimum penalty of 0). Choose one natural attack type the animal form has, such as bite or claws. The critical multiplier for this attack type increases by 1 (maximum ×4). <br><br><b>Augmented (2nd)<\/b>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. During each casting of the spell, a number of times equal to your tier, you can act as if you had the Natural Spell feat for 1 round. For example, if you’re 2nd tier, you can use the Natural Spell feat for 2 rounds per casting of <i>mythic beast shape<\/i>.",
