    "text": "You cast this spell immediately prior to resting. While under the effects of this spell, you and your allies enjoy a restful night’s sleep. If a subject completes a full night’s rest, it regains hit points as if it had undergone a full day of bed rest (regaining twice its character level in hit points). If a subject completes a full day’s rest, it regains three times its character level in hit points. Any significant interruption during the rest (such as being awoken) prevents any healing that night and ends the effect of this spell on the awakened subject. Any healing acquired while under the effects of <i>restful sleep <\/i>is considered natural healing, and has no affect on effects requiring magical healing to cure.",
