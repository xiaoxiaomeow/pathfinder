The building to be teleported must be unoccupied, and the area to which you wish to move the building must be cleared and unoccupied during the casting of this spell. A building cannot be teleported to an area it would not normally be able to occupy, such as an area adjacent to a prohibited building type. If you don’t wholly own the structure, all of the structure’s owners must consent to the structure’s teleportation before the spell is cast; otherwise, it fails immediately.<br><br>This spell only functions on buildings that occupy a number of lots equal to one-fourth your caster level (so, for instance, a 16th-level caster could use this spell on a building that occupies up to 4 lots).",
