    "text": "With a touch, you can determine the exact thickness of a wall, ceiling, or other solid barrier, measuring from the point you are touching to the direct opposite side of the barrier in a straight line. You can only detect depths or widths of up to 10 feet per caster level (maximum 200 feet at 20th level); amounts in excess of this limit are detected as being the maximum you are able to detect. So, for example, a 5th-level wizard using this spell on a 60-foot-thick wall would detect that the wall is 50 feet thick.<br><br><i>Determine depth <\/i>can be used on earthen, plaster, stone, or wooden surfaces, but not on walls made of metal or other, harder materials. This spell is useful to casters who want to get an idea of their surroundings, and as a preliminary measure to casting spells such as <i>passwall <\/i>or <i>dimension door<\/i>.",

    "text_zh": "<p>透过触摸，你能够判定墙、天花板或其他固态障碍物的准确厚度，测量点从你接触的地方笔直地向障碍物的另一侧直行。你只能够侦测至多10尺/等级(最大200尺/20等)的深度或厚度; 超过这个极限的数值，会变成你能够侦测到的最大值。所以，举例来说，一位5等的法师对伊面60尺厚的墙使用此法术，他将会侦测到这面墙是50尺厚。<\/p><p>判定深度可以用在泥土、灰泥、岩石或木头的表面上，但不能是比金属或著其他更坚硬材质造的表面。这法术对那些想要在自身周遭动脑筋的施法者来说很有用，并可以是施展像是穿墙术(passwall)或任意门(dimension door)的前置措施。<\/p>"
