    "text": "Casting a <i>gate<\/i> spell has two effects. First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.<br><br>Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the <i>gate<\/i>.<br><br>The <i>gate<\/i> itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice) oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.<br><br>A <i>gate<\/i> has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the <i>gate<\/i> from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.<br><br><i>Planar Travel<\/i>: As a mode of planar travel, a <i>gate<\/i> spell functions much like a <i>plane shift<\/i> spell, except that the <i>gate<\/i> opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a gate from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you—anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A gate cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.<br><br>You may hold the <i>gate<\/i> open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.<br><br><i>Calling Creatures<\/i>: The second effect of the <i>gate<\/i> spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the <i>gate<\/i> to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the <i>gate<\/i>, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a <i>gate<\/i> that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has a material cost of 10,000 gp in rare incense and offerings. This cost is in addition to any cost that must be paid to the called creatures.<br><br>If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual, you may call either a single creature or several creatures. In either case, their total HD cannot exceed twice your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD does not exceed your caster level. A creature with more HD than your caster level can't be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.<br><br>If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the <i>lesser planar ally<\/i> spell for appropriate rewards. Some creatures may want their payment in “livestock” rather than in coin, which could involve complications. Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.<br><br>Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.<br><br><i>Note<\/i>: When you use a calling spell such as gate to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type.",

    "text_zh": "<p>施放异界之门法术有两种效果。首先，它创造了一个连接你所在位面和你指定位面的跨维度连接，可以在两个位面之间双向旅行。其次，你可以通过这个异界之门呼唤一个特定个体或一类存在。<\/p><p>异界之门本身是一个圆环或圆盘，直径从5到20尺不等 (由施法者决定)，在成形的时候由你决定开口方向 (通常为竖直的，且面向你)。这是一个观察那个指定位面 (施法时指定) 的二维窗口，穿过它的任何人或任何东西都会立刻转移到在另一方。<\/p><p>异界之门有正面和反面。从正面穿过异界之门的生物会传送到另外那个位面; 从反面穿过则不会。<\/p><p><b>位面旅行 (Planar Travel)<\/b>：作为位面旅行的一种方式，异界之门的作用很像‘<a href=\"spell.html?spell=plane shift\">异界传送 (plane shift)<\/a>’，不过异界之门会正好在你指定地点打开 (这是创造效果)。神祇和其他统治该位面的生物如果愿意，可以阻止在他们所在或所拥有的地区打开异界之门。旅行者不需要和你手拉手——任何走入传送门的人都会被传送。异界之门不能在同一位面的另外地点打开; 该法术只能用于位面间旅行。<\/p><p>你只能保持这个异界之门开放很短的时间 (不能超过每CL 1轮)，期间你必须保持专注，否则跨位面连接会被切断。<\/p><p><b>呼唤生物 (Calling Creatures)<\/b>：异界之门的第二种效果是呼唤一个跨位面生物来援助你 (这是呼唤效果)。施法时通过叫出一个特定生物或一种生物的名字，你能让异界之门紧挨着该生物打开，之后不管它是否愿意都会被拉过传送门。神祇或独一无二的生物不会被迫穿过异界之门，但是他们可以根据自己的愿望决定这样做。法术的这种用法所创造的异界之门仅仅能持续到被呼唤的生物被传送为止。法术的这种用法需要消耗价值10000gp的焚香和祭品。这些材料成分是独立于任何支付给被呼唤生物酬金之外的开销。<\/p><p>如果你决定呼唤一种生物而非呼唤一个已知的个体，你可以选择只呼唤一个生物或者多个生物。无论你选择哪种，你能呼唤出的生物HD总数均不能超过你的CL的两倍。在选择只呼唤一个生物的情况下，如果他的HD不超过你CL，你就可以控制他。单个生物的HD若超过你CL则不会被你控制。神祇和独一无二的生物在任何情况下都不可能被控制。未被控制的生物可以按自己意愿行动，因此呼唤这类生物很危险。未被控制的生物可以在任何时候回到原属位面。<\/p><p>你可以命令被控制的生物来为你提供服务。这类服务分两类：即时任务和契约服务。为你在一场战斗中作战，或做其他可以在每CL 1轮的时间内完成的活动算作即时任务; 你不需要为此订立任何协议或支付任何报酬。在法术结束的时候生物会离开。<\/p><p>如果你选择让被呼唤的生物做一些更持久或更复杂的服务，你必须进行一些公平交易来换取这种服务。你要求的服务应该和你许诺的报酬相当; 适用的报酬见‘<a href=\"spell.html?spell=lesser planar ally\">次等异界盟友 (lesser planar ally)<\/a>’。对有些生物来说，他们更希望报酬是“牲畜”而非钱币，而这样可能会比较牵涉到许多麻烦。当任务完成的时候，生物会被立刻传送到你身边，而你必须在此时此地支付你所许诺的报酬。当这些都完成的时候，生物立刻可以自由返回他自己的位面。<\/p><p>如果你未能丝毫不差地支付许诺的报酬，最好的情况是你必须为这个生物或他的主人服务。最坏的情况是，这个生物或他的同族会攻击你。<\/p><p>注意：当使用异界之门这类呼唤法术呼唤一个气系、混乱、土系、邪恶、火系、善良、秩序，或水系亚种的生物时，此法术也成为相应类型法术。<\/p>"
