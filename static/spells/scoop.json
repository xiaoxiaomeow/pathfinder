As a move action, you can direct the container up to 15 feet per round in any direction, though the spell ends if the distance between you and the container ever exceeds the spell’s range. You can dip the container to pick up or drop a liquid as a move action. The vessel holds up to 1 pint of liquid or small objects, weighing up to 5 pounds. You can also gather up a pint of liquid or small objects spread cross a surface with 1 minute of careful concentration.<br><br><i>Note from Jason Bulmahn<\/i>: The following spells are different from your standard cantrips. They are rare cantrips. Spellcasters that gain access to all 0-level spells at 1st level do not gain access to rare cantrips. A spellcaster gains access to rare cantrips only by uncovering their secrets in some other way. Some are guarded by jealous mages, while others are lost in missing libraries or molder on forgotten scrolls.<br><br>These cantrips are not legal in Pathfinder Society play. Note that <i>penumbra<\/i> was changed into the higher-level spell <i>protective penumbra<\/i>. The cantrip version is similar, but does not replace its higher-level counterpart.",
