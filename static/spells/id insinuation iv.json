In addition, on the first round of the effect, you can select the result of each creature’s confused condition without having to roll, but this doesn’t allow you to make any decisions about how that result is applied. On the following rounds of the effect, the targets of this spell must roll twice to determine their confused effect. You select which roll is used. This spell can be undercast.",
