    "text": "This spell allows you to assume the form of a Large living tree or shrub or a Large dead tree trunk with a small number of limbs. The exact type of tree, as well as its appearance, is completely under your control. Even the closest inspection cannot reveal that the tree in question is actually a magically concealed creature. To all normal tests you are, in fact, a tree or shrub, although a <i>detect magic<\/i> spell reveals a faint transmutation on the tree. While in tree form, you can observe all that transpires around you just as if you were in your normal form, and your hit points and save bonuses remain unaffected. You gain a +10 natural armor bonus to AC but have an effective Dexterity score of 0 and a speed of 0 feet. You are immune to critical hits while in tree form. All clothing and gear carried or worn changes with you. You can dismiss <i>tree shape<\/i> as a free action (instead of as a standard action).",

    "text_zh": "<p>本法术能让你把自己变成一棵大型活树或灌木，或是大型枯死树干，还带有些小树枝。树木的确切类型，还有外观都完全受到你的控制。即使凑近仔细看，也觉察不出这树实际上是用魔法伪装的生物。实际上无论用什么正常手段检查，你都是棵树或灌木，但‘<a href=\"spell.html?spell=detect magic\">侦测魔法 (detect magic)<\/a>’会侦测出树上有变化系的微弱法术灵光。变成树后，你仍可观察周围事物，就如同你在正常的形态下一般，你的HP和豁免加值也不受影响。你的AC获得+10的天生护甲加值，但是有效敏捷属性为0且速度为0尺。变成树后，你对重击免疫。你身上的所有衣物、装备都会一起变形。你能以自由动作解消树化术 (而非标准动作)。<\/p>"
