Otherwise, this spell functions like <i>nightmare<\/i> (see <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 316<\/i>), save that the subject matter of the dream always involves demons. Upon waking from a <i>demon dream<\/i>, the victim must make a saving throw against the spell to resist taking 1d6 points of Wisdom drain from the unsettling, madness- inducing dream—this is in addition to the damage and fatigue normally caused by the <i>nightmare<\/i>.",
