This damage is dealt only once, on the round the spell is cast. For the remaining duration of the spell, fine dust rains down in the area. Creatures other than stone giants inside this area take a –4 penalty on Perception skill checks, and the entire area is treated as difficult terrain. At the end of the spell’s duration, the gravel and dust disappear, leaving no trace of their presence.",
