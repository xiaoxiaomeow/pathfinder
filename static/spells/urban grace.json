In addition, it does not cost you 2 squares of movement to enter a square with crowds, though the crowd still provides cover to you. This ability does not allow you to enter the space of enemy creatures without making the appropriate Acrobatics check. In addition, you receive a +4 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks made to move across uneven urban surfaces, such as roofs and broken pavement, and on Climb checks made to scale walls and other artificial surfaces. Whenever you make an Acrobatics check to make a long jump between two buildings or artificial structures, you are always treated as if you had a running start, regardless of the actual distance traveled.",
