Each mythic form of the dragon spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version.<br><br> The spell’s bonuses to ability scores increase by 2, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the breath weapon damage increases by 2d8. All of the dragon form’s natural attacks increase by one step (see Improved Natural Attack on page 315 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary<\/i>).<br><br><b>Augmented (3rd)<\/b>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. During each casting of the spell, you can revert to your normal form or back to your dragon form without ending the spell a number of times equal to your tier. ",
