It functions as a magic and good weapon for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. The weapon grants a +2 sacred bonus on attack rolls against undead and deals +1d6 points of damage on a successful hit against such foes; against incorporeal undead, it functions as if it had the <i>ghost touch<\/i> weapon special ability. The weapon automatically confirms critical hits against foes that are vulnerable to sunlight.",
