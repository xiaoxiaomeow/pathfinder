First, the affected creature gains the ability to create a sound like the blast of a mighty horn or trumpet simply by miming the action of sounding one. Second, the subject can speak in a booming voice that carries easily over great distances, lowering the DC of any check to hear what is said by –15. This spell is particularly prized by battlefield commanders and champions who wish to make themselves clearly heard or gain the attention of their allies or foes.",
