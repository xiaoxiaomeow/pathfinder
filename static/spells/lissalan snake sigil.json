This is a poison effect.<br><br><i>Enchantment<\/i>: The target takes a 1d6 penalty to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. This is a compulsion effect.<br><br><i>Evocation<\/i>: The target gains vulnerability to an energy type, chosen randomly from the following: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. This is an acid, cold, electricity, or fire effect.<br><br><i>Illusion<\/i>: The target’s vision is blurred, giving it a –4 penalty on Perception checks relating to vision, and the target treats all other creatures as having <i>displacement<\/i>.
