    "mythicText": "Each <i>mythic elemental body<\/i> spell must be learned individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic <i>elemental body<\/i> spell to learn its mythic version. You don’t have to learn them in order, and aren’t required to know a lower-level <i>mythic elemental body<\/i> spell before you learn a higher-level one (for example, you can learn <i>mythic elemental body II<\/i> if you know <i>elemental body II<\/i>, even if you don’t know <i>mythic elemental body I<\/i>). Each <i>mythic elemental body<\/i> spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version. The spell’s bonuses to ability scores increase by 2, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the ability score penalties decrease by 2 (minimum penalty of 0). There is a 50% chance any critical hit or sneak attack against you is treated as a normal hit, as if you were wearing <i>medium fortification<\/i> armor.<br><br><b>Augmented (3rd)<\/b>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. You can also, a number of times equal to your tier, add half your tier to the DC of one spell you cast with an energy descriptor that matches your elemental type (air: electricity, earth: acid, fire: fire, water: cold).",
