    "text": "This spell transforms your targets into trees as per <i>tree shape<\/i>, except the targets transform into living trees that resemble their original forms. If a target is in a situation that would prove fatal to a tree created by this spell, such as off the ground or under water, the target receives a +4 bonus on its Fortitude save.<br><br> If the spell succeeds, the target must also attempt a Will save. On a failed save, the creature loses the ability to observe what transpires around it, and its mental capacity reverts to that of a tree, rendering it unable to take any kind of action. A target that succeeds at the saving throw can observe the area around it but can't take any actions other than communicate to those under the effects of a <i>speak with plants<\/i> spell or to other trees. Over the span of 1 year, the target's appearance becomes more like a common tree and less like its original form.<br><br> Any polymorph effects on a target are automatically dispelled when the target fails to resist the effects of <i>rival's weald<\/i>, and as long as <i>rival's weald<\/i> remains in effect, the target cannot use other polymorph spells or effects to assume a new form. Incorporeal, gaseous, and plant creatures are immune to <i>rival's weald<\/i>.",
