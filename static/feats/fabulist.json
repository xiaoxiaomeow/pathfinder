    "prerequisites": "Amateur Gunslinger feat or grit class feature.",
    "benefit": "You gain a +1 bonus on Perform (act, comedy, oratory, and sing) skill checks, and Perform is a class skill for you. In addition, each time you make a successful Bluff check to convince someone of a far-fetched or impossible story, you regain 1 grit point. Successfully lying to a friendly or helpful creature, or a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half your character level, doesn’t restore grit.",

    "prerequisites_zh": "业余枪手或勇毅职业特性。",
    "benefit_zh": "你在表演（戏剧，喜剧，朗诵和演唱）技能检定上获得+1加值，且表演对你来说是本职技能。此外，每次你成功用唬骗检定说服他人相信一个牵强或不可能的故事时，你重获1点勇毅。成功骗过一个友善或乐于帮助的生物，或者生命骰少于你角色等级一半的生物，并不会恢复勇毅。"
