    "benefit": "You can attempt a skill check to aid an ally within 30 feet with a skill in which you are trained. This takes 1 minute, and during that time, you need only speak and be heard by your chosen ally to offer this aid. The bonus you grant is +2, regardless of any other effects that would alter your aid another bonus. This bonus applies to all checks the ally attempts with that skill for 1 day and does not stack with any other aid another bonus. Whether you succeed at or fail the skill check to aid another, you can attempt to use this ability only once per day for each ally.",

    "benefit_zh": "你能够尝试1次技能检定为30尺内的1名盟友提供协助（aid），不过前提是你必须在该项技能中受训。这会耗费1分钟，而且在此期间内，你需要在动嘴说的同时，让接受该次建议的盟友听到你说的话。你赋予的加值为+2点，并且忽略任何可能改变你的协助他人加值（aid another bonus）的任何其他效果。该加值会适用于此盟友使用对应技能尝试的全部检定，它会持续1日，而且不会与任何其他协助他人加值叠加。无论你在协助他人的检定中成功与否，每日你仅能为每名盟友尝试使用1次该能力。"
