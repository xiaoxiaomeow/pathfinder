    "text": "You felt the powerful wings of Talmandor surround you when you risked death from a fall, and somehow a tiny spark of his essence remains connected to your soul.",
    "prerequisites": "Take at least 10d6 falling damage on three different occasions and survive.",
    "benefit": "When you cast a healing spell on an unharmed creature, it briefly manifests as a pair of wings made of golden light. The spell’s duration becomes “1 hour or until discharged.” For the next hour, the spell remains on the target, triggering automatically as a swift action if the creature takes damage or experiences an effect that the spell could cure, mitigate, or remove (which causes the wings of light to appear briefly).<br><br>For example, if you cast <i>lesser restoration<\/i> on an ally who had no ability damage, the spell would trigger immediately if the target became fatigued, exhausted, or took ability damage, but not if the target suffered ability drain, energy drain, or hit point damage (none of which are affected by <i>lesser restoration<\/i>).",

    "text_zh": "当你在碰上会致死的坠落事件时，你感觉到强力的天堂之翼保护着你。而且这股力量仍以某种方式连结到你的灵魂。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "至少在三个不同的地方受到10d6的坠落伤害并且活下来。",
    "benefit_zh": "当你将治疗法术施放在没有受伤的生物身上时，他身上会短暂的出现一对发光的翅膀。而法术将会保存在对方身上每等级一小时直到触发。当生物受到了可以被该法术治疗、移除或是减轻的效果后，生物可以用一个迅捷动作触发该法术，这会让那对光翼短暂的显现。"
