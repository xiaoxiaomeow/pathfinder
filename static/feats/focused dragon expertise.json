    "benefit": "You gain a bonus on saving throws against breath weapons and fear effects equal to half your favored enemy (dragon) bonus. Whenever you succeed at a Reflex saving throw against a dragon’s extraordinary or supernatural ability that would deal half damage, you instead take no damage. If you already have the evasion class feature, you instead gain an inquisitor’s stalwart ability (<i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player’s Guide 41<\/i>) against dragons’ extraordinary and supernatural abilities."
