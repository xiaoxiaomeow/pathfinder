    "text": "Finding just the right pressure point, you paralyze your foe with a single hit.",
    "prerequisites": "Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +14.",
    "benefit": "You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). Paralyzing Strike forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. A defender who fails this saving throw is paralyzed for 1 round, until just before your next turn. You can attempt to use Paralyzing Strike once per day for every 4 character levels you have, but no more than once per round. Constructs, incorporeal creatures, plants, undead, and creatures that are immune to critical hits cannot be affected by this ability.",

    "text_zh": "你巧妙的一击命中对手的秘孔，使他全身僵直。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "敏捷13，感知13，精通徒手击打，BAB+14。",
    "benefit_zh": "你必须在投掷攻击骰之前宣告使用此专长（因此，未命中会导致尝试失败）。定身拳在正常造成伤害的同时，还会强制受到你徒手击打伤害的敌人进行一次DC=10+1/2你的角色等级+感知调整值的强韧豁免检定。豁免检定失败的防御者将麻痹1轮或直到受到任何造成生命值伤害的法术为止。每4级你每天可以多尝试一次取力攻击，每轮不能超过1次。构装、泥怪、植物、不死、虚体生物和免疫重击的生物不会被本能力影响。",
    "staminaText_zh": "你可以消耗5点耐力来在你使用徒手击打击中敌人之后宣告使用这个专长。"
