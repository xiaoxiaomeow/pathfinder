    "benefit": "When you are concentrating to maintain a spell from the pattern subschool, you can move any area effects associated with that spell by up to 10 feet as a move action. Creatures within the new area of effect are subject to the spell as if it had just been cast (attempting saves as normal). When concentrating on a pattern spell that already allows you to move the effect, such as <i>rainbow pattern<\/i>, increase the distance you can move the pattern by 50%.",
