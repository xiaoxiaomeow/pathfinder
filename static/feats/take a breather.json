    "text": "You can use lapses in your opponent’s guard to recuperate from the wounds you have already sustained.",
    "prerequisites": "Con 13, Combat Vigor, character level 4th.",
    "benefit": "Your vigor pool gains 1 vigor point. Whenever an opponent that you threaten provokes an attack of opportunity from you, as a swift action you can spend 1 or more vigor points to regain hit points as described by the Combat Vigor feat, instead of making an attack of opportunity against that opponent. Spending vigor in this manner does not count against the total number of attacks of opportunity that you can make during a round.",

    "text_zh": "你可以借用对手防御的失误来恢复自己受到的伤害。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "体质13，战斗活力，角色等级4。",
    "benefit_zh": "你的活力池获得1点活力。每当你威胁的敌人触发了你的借机攻击，你可以用一个迅捷动作花费1点或者更多的活力点，如同战斗活力专长描述的那样治疗自己，这样做会取代你对对手做出的借机攻击。在这个情况下花费活力点并不会计入你本轮的借机攻击次数。"
