    "prerequisites": "Int 13, Combat Expertise, Improved Reposition, Whipcrack, base attack bonus +6 or monk level 3rd.",
    "benefit": "When you successfully reposition an opponent, if you attempt to reposition it into a square already occupied by another creature, you can attempt a combat maneuver check as an immediate action to reposition that creature. You take a –4 penalty on this check. If you are successful, the second creature is pushed 5 feet in the direction of your original target’s movement. You can move the secondary target an additional 5 feet for every 5 by which you exceed the secondary target’s CMD. The secondary target does not provoke attacks of opportunity because of this movement unless you have the Greater Reposition feat. If you fail your combat maneuver check, the movement of your original target ends in front of the secondary target.",
