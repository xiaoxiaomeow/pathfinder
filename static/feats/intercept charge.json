    "text": "You can get in the way of an opponent charging your ally.",
    "benefit": "When an opponent charges your ally with this feat, as an immediate action you can move up to your speed toward any square in the path of the charge. If you end your movement in the path of the charge, the opponent must stop when it becomes adjacent to you and then attack you instead of your ally. Your movement from using this feat counts toward your movement on your next turn.",

    "benefit_zh": "每当有敌人向同样拥有此专长的盟友发动冲锋时，以一个直觉动作，你可以立刻以你的速度移动到对方冲锋的路径上任一格将其挡住，当你到达冲锋路径上后，该敌人必须在邻接你格子停下并且对你发动攻击。以此专长进行的移动计入你下一轮的移动之中。",
    "staminaText_zh": "当你使用这个专长时，你可以消耗5点耐力不让你的移动计入你下一回合的移动中。"
