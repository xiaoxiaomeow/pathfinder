Any nonlethal damage you would have taken from the original effect is reduced to its minimum value (as though a 1 had been rolled on all dice). You cannot activate this ability if you are currently dazed.<br><br> You can use this feat’s benefit once per day, plus an additional time per day for every 5 ranks you have in Knowledge (planes).",
