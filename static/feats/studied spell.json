    "text": "You use your knowledge about the target to bypass its resistances and damage reduction.",
    "benefit": "When casting a studied spell, designate one target affected by the spell. Attempt an appropriate Knowledge check based on that target’s creature type as you cast the spell. The DC for this check is equal to 20 + the creature’s CR based on its race and not including any class levels or template (a creature that is defined by class levels has an effective CR of 0 for this ability). If you succeed, your studied spell ignores any energy resistance or damage reduction the target has because of its race as well as any bonuses on saving throws against the spell granted by the target’s race (such as the bonus from a dwarf ’s hardy ability or a halfling’s halfling luck ability). Your studied spell doesn’t ignore energy resistance, damage reduction, or saving throw bonuses granted by other spells and effects. If you fail the Knowledge check, the spell still has its normal effects. A studied spell uses up a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell’s actual level.",

    "benefit_zh": "当你施放格物法术时，从受到该法术影响的目标中指定1名。在你施放法术时，基于这个目标生物的生物类型，尝试1次合适的知识检定。此次检定的DC为20 + 该生物的CR（该CR要基于这个生物的种族，而不包括任何职业等级或模板），由职业等级来确定CR的生物在该能力中的有效CR为0。若你的检定成功，你的格物法术会忽略该目标通过种族而获得的任何能量抗力（energy resistance）或伤害减免（damage reduction）、以及对抗法术时生效的任何豁免检定加值；比如矮人（Dwarves）的坚韧（Hardy）种族特性或者半身人（Halflings）的半身人幸运（Halfling Luck）种族特性。你的格物法术不会忽略由于其他法术和效果而带来的能量抗力、伤害减免或豁免检定加值。若你的知识检定失败了，该法术仍会产生正常的效果。格物法术使用比法术的实际环级高2级的法术位。"
