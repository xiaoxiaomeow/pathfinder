    "text": "Hexing your enemies causes them to be ensnared in tangling vines.",
    "prerequisites": "Hex class feature; summer, thorns, or woodlands patron.",
    "benefit": "When you gain this feat, choose one hex that you can use to affect no more than one opponent. If the target of your hex fails its saving throw to resist your hex, the square it occupies becomes overgrown with thorny plants that count as difficult terrain. A creature moving in or out of the square must succeed at a Reflex save or Acrobatics check (DC = 10 + half your level + your Charisma modifier) or take 1d6 points of piercing damage and immediately end its movement. For every 5 by which the target fails its save against your hex, you can create 1 additional square of difficult terrain adjacent to any square the target occupies. The difficult terrain lasts a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). The ground must be composed of a material able to support plant life (such as soil)."
