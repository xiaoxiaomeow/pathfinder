    "prerequisites": "5 or more Hit Dice, good alignment.",
    "benefit": "You can alter the essence of your being to lessen the effects of spells designed to harm good creatures. When affected by spells and effects that behave differently according to alignment (such as <i>unholy word<\/i> or <i>protection from good<\/i>), you can choose whether you are considered good or neutral. This ability does not actually change your alignment or fool divinations, nor does it permit you to overcome alignment requirements for the use of magic items, class abilities, and so on.",

    "text_zh": "你的纯洁一向是种祝福，即便被鄙弃它的生物包围时仍是如此。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "5个HD或以上，善良阵营。",
    "benefit_zh": "你可以改变自身存在的本质，借此降低那些意图伤害善良生物的法术或效果对你造成的影响。当你受到会根据阵营而有不同效果的法术或效果时（如渎神之语或防护善良），你可以选择自己要被视作善良或中立阵营。此能力并未真正改变你的阵营，也无法愚弄预言系法术，更无法让你得以使用那些具有阵营限制的魔法物品、职业能力等等。"
