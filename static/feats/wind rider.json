    "text": "You have trained yourself to move and fight in strong winds, allowing you to use their elemental power to boost your own speed.",
    "prerequisites": "Acrobatics or Fly 3 ranks.",
    "benefit": "When flying within strong winds, you gain a +15-foot bonus to your fly speed. For every wind strength category above strong, you gain an additional +15-foot bonus to your fly speed (for a total of +30 feet in severe winds, +45 feet in a windstorm, and +60 feet in tornadoes). This feat does not give you any bonuses on Fly or Strength checks to determine if you are potentially checked or blown away."
