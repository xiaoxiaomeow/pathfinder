    "text": "You go wild when someone tries to steal the words from your head.",
    "prerequisites": "Goblin, rage class feature.",
    "benefit": "If someone reads or writes in your presence (including casting spells like <i>glyph of warding <\/i>or <i>symbol<\/i>) you can, as an immediate action, choose to activate your rage class ability for 1 round. This round of rage does not count toward the total number of rounds which you can rage each day, but if you wish to continue your rage beyond that single round you must expend rounds from your daily rage allotment as normal. Once you use this feat you must wait at least 1 minute after you cease raging before you can use it again."
