    "benefit": "Each time you make a full attack wielding a pair of daggers or a pair of kama and hit a creature with both weapons, you reduce its armor bonus to AC by 1 until the beginning of your next turn. This reduction stacks to a minimum armor bonus of +0. For example, if you hit a creature wearing a chain shirt with two primary attacks and two off-hand attacks, you would reduce its armor bonus to AC from +4 to +2.",

    "benefit_zh": "每当你用一对匕首或一对单镰进行全力攻击，并且同时用两把武器命中一名生物时，你可以使其护甲AC降低1点，此效果持续到你下回合开始。此减值可以叠加到将对方的护甲加值降至+0。举例来说，若你用两次主手攻击与两次副手攻击命中一名穿着链甲衫的敌人，那么你会将其护甲AC从+4降至+2。"
