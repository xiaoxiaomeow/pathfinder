    "benefit": "A jinxed creature cannot benefit from the effects of potions, elixirs, or any other substance that he must ingest in order to activate. This includes alchemical substances such as antitoxin, but not extracts, mutagens, or other alchemist class abilities that only affect the alchemist. A jinxed creature still takes any penalties and detrimental effects from ingested compounds or poisons."
