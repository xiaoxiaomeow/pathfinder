    "text": "Raising your voice together with your allies’, you wield sound itself as a weapon.",
    "prerequisites": "Perform (sing) 3 ranks.",
    "benefit": "As a standard action, you can attempt a DC 10 Perform (sing) check to aid an ally who also has this feat. If you succeed at the check, spells cast by your ally before the start of your next turn that deal acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage instead deal sonic damage. Spells that would normally deal sonic damage deal half sonic damage and half damage resulting directly from divine power that is not subject to being reduced by resistance to sonic attacks.",

    "text_zh": "通过与盟友一起高唱，你们将声音本身变成了武器。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "表演（歌唱）3级。",
    "benefit_zh": "通过一个标准动作，你可以尝试进行一次DC10的表演（歌唱）检定来协助一位同样拥有这一专长的盟友。如果检定成功，你的盟友在下一回合开始之前施放的造成强酸、寒冷、闪电或火焰伤害的法术伤害类型将会变成音波伤害。通常造成音波伤害的法术将会变成一半造成音波伤害，另一半伤害直接原自神力，因此抵抗音波攻击的方式无法对这一部分起作用。"
