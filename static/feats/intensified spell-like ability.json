You can use the chosen spell-like ability as an intensified spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).<br><br> When you use an intensified spell-like ability, the maximum number of the ability’s damage dice increases by 5 levels. You must have sufficient caster levels to surpass the normal maximum in order to benefit from this feat. No other variables of the spell-like ability are affected, and spell-like abilities that inflict damage that is not modified by caster level are not affected by this feat.<br><br> You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) – 1. For a summary, see Table 3–1.",
