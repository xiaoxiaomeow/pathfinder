    "text": "You’re even harder to see when prone than most are.",
    "benefit": "If you have been prone since the end of your last turn, the penalty on Perception checks for others to notice you increases by 1 for every 20 feet between you and the observer, to a maximum increase of 5 at 100 feet. This stacks with the normal modifier for distance.",
    "name_zh": "潜伏",
    "text_zh": "你匍匐时将更难被发现。",
    "benefit_zh": "若你从你的上一回合结束时就一直匍匐，通过察觉检定发现你的DC将会增加。你与搜索者之间距离每有20尺，DC就增加1。该专长带来的DC加值与正常情况下距离带来的察觉检定DC加值叠加。<\/p><p>注：根据察觉技能，正常情况下两者间距每10尺，察觉DC增加1。"
