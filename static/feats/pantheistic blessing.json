    "prerequisites": "Wis 13, must worship a pantheon of deities.",
    "benefit": "When taking this feat, select a pantheon from the list below. You gain the listed spell-like ability for your selected pantheon, usable once per day. If the granted spell allows a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma modifier.",
    "special": "If you act out of line with the tenets of your pantheon’s beliefs, you lose the ability to cast the granted spell-like ability until you have received an atonement for your transgression (as a cleric restoring lost class abilities). <h1 class=\"title\">Pantheons of Golarion<\/h1> Each pantheon below notes the type of pantheon, as well as the member deities and the most common sorts of worshipers found within the faith. Additionally, each pantheon grants a spell-like ability to followers who take the Pantheistic Blessing feat. An asterisk after a deity’s name indicates that he or she is the head of the pantheon. "
