    "prerequisites": "Cha 15.",
    "benefit": "All allies within 15 feet of you are only flat-footed during the first round of combat until your first turn. This does not prevent them from being flat-footed due to other situations, like being flanked. In addition, all allies within 15 feet of you gain a +1 dodge bonus to their Armor Class against all ranged attacks. These benefits only apply to those allies who can hear and understand you."
