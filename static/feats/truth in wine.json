    "benefit": "You can perform the psychometry occult skill unlock even if you canâ€™t use psychic magic, though you must consume a drink of high-quality alcohol (costing at least 10 gp per drink) to do so. If you can cast psychic spells or have the Psychic Sensitivity feat, you can use psychometry one additional time per day.<br><br> If you consume a drink of high-quality alcohol, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise and Sense Motive checks for 1 minute and can increase the caster level of the next divination spell you cast within 1 minute by 1. If you are addicted to alcohol, as described on page 236 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide<\/i>, these bonuses increase by 1, but so too does the save DC for your addiction."
