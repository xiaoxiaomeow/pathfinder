    "text": "Together, you and an ally can operate an oversized and unwieldy weapon.",
    "prerequisites": "Proficiency with light crossbow, heavy crossbow, or musket; size Small or Medium.",
    "benefit": "When you’re adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, together you count as being Large for the purpose of using Large light crossbows, Large heavy crossbows, and Large muskets. Firing such a weapon this way requires your ally to support the barrel or bow of the weapon. You must be able to trace a line from your space to the target’s space in such a way that the line passes through the ally’s space. The ally doesn’t provide soft cover to your target. Your ally uses her actions to load the weapon, and you use your actions to make attacks. Similarly, your ally’s feats and abilities apply to reloading, while your feats and abilities apply to making attacks. This feat does not allow you and your ally to act simultaneously on the same initiative.",

    "benefit_zh": "每当你邻接一个拥有此专长的盟友时，你们一起可以视为一个大型生物来使用大型的轻型十字弓，大型的重型十字弓和大型的滑膛枪，这样射击需要你的盟友帮你装弹和稳住瞄准。在这样射击时，你与远程攻击目标的射击线必须穿过辅助你的盟友，但该盟友不会对你的远程攻击的目标提供软隐蔽。在攻击时，你以你的动作发动远程攻击，而你的盟友则用他的动作装填武器；因此，你可以在这次攻击上使用所有与远程攻击相关的专长，而你的盟友则可以在装填时使用所有他的装填相关的专长。注意，本专长不会自动使你和你的盟友使用同一个先攻位行动。"
