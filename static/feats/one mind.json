    "prerequisites": "Alertness, Sense Motive 3 ranks, human (Vudrani).",
    "benefit": "Whenever you’re adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, if your ally is not flat-footed, you’re also not considered flat-footed before you act in combat (you might become flat-footed in other ways, however). Additionally, if your ally can see a creature that you can’t see, that creature doesn’t gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls against you from being invisible, nor do you take a –2 penalty to AC for being blinded if your ally can see.",
