    "url": "https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Energized%20Wild%20Shape",
    "source": ["Ultimate Wilderness pg. 110"],
    "text": "Your wild shape form gains the benefits of one energy type for both offensive and defensive purposes.",
    "prerequisites": "Wis 19, base attack bonus +6, wild shape class feature.",
    "benefit": "When you assume a wild shape form, choose one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. You gain resistance 10 to that energy type. Also, one of your natural attacks deals an additional 1d6 points of damage of the chosen energy type. If you choose a wild shape form that already has energy resistance of the same type you choose, it increases by 5 instead. If you choose a wild shape form that deals damage of the same energy type you choose, increase the energy damage you deal by one die size (1d6 becomes 1d8, and so on).",
    "special": "You can take this feat more than once. Each time you take this feat, choose a different energy type."
