    "prerequisites": "Second judgment class feature.",
    "benefit": "You can pronounce a single judgment and extend its effects to one adjacent ally instead of pronouncing a second judgment. Similarly, once you have the third judgment class feature, you can pronounce a single judgment and extend its effects to two adjacent allies instead of pronouncing a second and third judgment. Alternatively, once you have the third judgment class feature, you can pronounce two judgments and extend the effects of one judgment to one adjacent ally instead of pronouncing a third judgment. Once an ally has gained the effects of your judgment, he need not remain adjacent to you to continue gaining that benefit. You can spend a free action to end this benefit for one or both allies. If your judgment bonus is suspended for you, it is suspended for all allies, but when it resumes, it does so for all allies.",

    "benefit_zh": "你能够声明一项审判、并让1名邻接同伴共享其效果，而非声明第二项审判。类似地，当你获得【三重审判】职业特性后，你能够声明一项审判、并让2名邻接同伴共享其效果。你也能在获得【三重审判】职业特性后，声明两项审判、并让1名邻接同伴共享其中一项审判的效果，而非声明第三项审判。当你的同伴获得共享效果后，无需保持与你邻接也能持续受益。你能以自由动作结束与1名或2名同伴的共享。若你的审判加值因故被压制，你的所有同伴获得的共享效果也将被压制；但在效果恢复时他们的共享也能恢复。"
