    "text": "Your critical hits blind your opponents.",
    "prerequisites": "Critical Focus, base attack bonus +15.",
    "benefit": "Whenever you score a critical hit, your opponent is permanently blinded. A successful Fortitude save reduces this to dazzled for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. This feat has no effect on creatures that do not rely on eyes for sight or creatures with more than two eyes (although multiple critical hits might cause blindness, at the GM's discretion). Blindness can be cured by <i>heal<\/i>, <i>regeneration<\/i>, <i>remove blindness<\/i>, or similar abilities.",
    "special": "You can only apply the effects of one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess Critical Mastery.",

    "staminaText": "When you confirm a critical hit and attempt to blind an opponent with this feat, you can spend up to 5 stamina points to increase the DC of this feat’s saving throw by an amount equal to the number of stamina points you spent.",

    "benefit_zh": "你的重击会让你的敌人永久目盲。成功的强韧豁免会将目盲效果减弱为目眩，持续1d4轮。强韧豁免的DC为“10+你的BAB”。本专长对视觉不依赖眼睛或多于两只眼睛的生物无效（虽然多次重击可能会使所有的眼睛目盲，由GM决定）。目盲可由‘医疗术’、‘再生术’、‘移除目盲’法术或类似能力治愈。",
    "special_zh": "在没有掌握“重击熟稔”专长前，每次重击时你只能选择一种重击专长效果。",
    "staminaText_zh": "当你重击确认并尝试用该专长令目标致盲时，通过花费最多不超过5点耐力，你可以提升豁免DC等同所耗费的耐力点。"
