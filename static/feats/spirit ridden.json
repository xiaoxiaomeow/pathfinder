    "text": "You can invite lesser spirits to partially share your body in exchange for their training and experience.",
    "benefit": "You can perform a seance once per day, taking 1 hour and requiring your concentration, calling out to any nearby spirit with the skill you seek. At the end of the hour, you invite the spirit to inhabit your body. The spirit grants you ranks in a skill of your choice equal to your character level, and you treat the skill as a class skill. These effects persist for 1 hour per character level. You cannot have more ranks in a skill than your total number of Hit Dice. While you’re possessed, the spirit influences your personality.",
