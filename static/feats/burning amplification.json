    "text": "You can expend some of the energy of your fire spells to make the flames linger long enough to cause your opponents to catch ablaze.",
    "benefit": "Whenever you cast a spell with the fire descriptor, you can take a –1 penalty on the spells’ attack rolls and reduce the spell’s saving throw DC by 1 to cause any target that is dealt fire damage to catch on fire (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444<\/i>). The targets do not take burning damage for catching on fire until their next turn, and each target can attempt a Reflex saving throw to put out the fire before being damaged each round. Rather than the normal DC 15 Reflex saving throw to put the fire out, the target must succeed at a Reflex saving throw with a DC equal 10 + the spell’s level + the modifier of your spellcasting ability score). You must choose to use this feat before making an attack roll or before your targets attempt their saving throws. This feat has no effect on spells that neither allow a saving throw nor require an attack roll.",

    "text_zh": "你能放大某些你火焰法术中的能量，使得火焰徘徊足够久到让你的对手着火。",
    "benefit_zh": "每当你释放一个带有【火焰】描述符的法术，你可以选择在该法术攻击骰上承受-1罚值并降低法术豁免DC1，使得任何受到该法术火焰伤害的目标被点燃。目标直到他们下一轮前不会受到点燃伤害，并且每个目标每轮可以尝试一个反射豁免骰在被伤害前扑灭身上的火。取代正常扑灭火的DC15反射豁免，目标必须通过DC等于10+法术环级+你施法主属性调整值的反射豁免。你必须在进行攻击骰或在你的目标尝试进行豁免骰之前选择是否使用该专长。该专长对那些既不需要攻击骰又不需要进行豁免的法术无效。"
