    "benefit": "When you use Dimensional Awareness to make an attack of opportunity against a creature being summoned or called into a square you threaten, you can additionally use an immediate action to attempt to send the creature back to its home plane.

If you succeed, the creature does not get to act and is immediately sent back to its home plane.",
