    "benefit": "When you cast a divination spell using verdant salts as an esoteric material component, you’re more likely to get good information. You gain one of the following benefits, as appropriate to the spell: you increase the likelihood of a percentage-based divination to work correctly by 5% (giving a –5 penalty on the d% roll for <i>contact other plane<\/i>, for example), you gain a +2 competence bonus on Perception checks while perceiving through a divination (scrying) spell such as <i>scrying<\/i>, or you can ask one additional question (with <i>contact other plane<\/i> or <i>speak with dead<\/i>).<br><br> When you gain verdant salts’ greater component effect with a divination spell, increase the DC by an additional 1.",
