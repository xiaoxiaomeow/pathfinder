    "name": "Shadow's Shroud",
    "url": "https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Shadow's%20Shroud",
    "descriptors": ["Conduit"],
    "source": ["Planar Adventures pg. 32"],
    "text": "You can camouflage yourself in shadows and gloom.",
    "prerequisites": "Knowledge (planes) 5 ranks.",
    "benefit": "As a swift action, you can shroud yourself in shifting, camouflaging shadow. While shrouded in this fashion, you can attempt Stealth checks as though you had concealment, even in areas of normal or bright light. Creatures that can see normally in supernatural darkness can still see you normally.<br><br> You can use this feat’s benefit for a number of rounds per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). These rounds need not be consecutive.",
    "special": "Unlike spells like <i>shadow walk<\/i>, which require you to be on a plane that is coterminous with the Shadow Plane, this feat functions even on planes that do not normally share a border with the Shadow Plane. Like all conduit feats, the effects are suppressed when planar travel is forbidden.",
    "name_zh": "暗影护罩",
    "text_zh": "你可以利用黑暗与阴影来伪装自己",
    "prerequisites_zh": "知识（位面）5级。",
    "benefit_zh": "以一个迅捷动作，你能用可移动的伪装阴影包裹自己。当你处于此状态时，即使在常光或强光环境中，你也能尝试潜行检定，就像你正处于隐蔽时一样，能在超自然黑暗中如常视物的生物仍然可以如常看到你。你每天可以从这个专长获益的轮数等于你在知识（位面）上的等级数。这些轮数不需连续使用。",
    "special_zh": "本专长不像行影术(shadow walk)那样的法术要求你在一个与影界可能建立联系的位面才能使用，本专长甚至在通常不与影界有任何关联的位面上也能发挥作用。不过与所有汲引专长一样，当处于无法进行位面或次元旅行或者受次元锚(dimensional anchor)影响时，专长效果会被抑制。"
