    "benefit": "You can invest mental focus in your body rather than an implement. When you invest mental focus this way, you treat your body as an implement of any implement school you know. You do not gain the resonant power for the chosen school, but you treat your occultist level as 1 higher for the purposes of that school’s focus powers. You can change which implement school is tied to your body when you invest your chosen implements for the day.",

    "benefit_zh": "你可以将心智点填充入自己的身体中而非一件灵器中。当你以这种方式获得心智点时，你可以将身体作为任意一种已知灵器学派。你不会获得所选学派的共鸣之力，但在使用灵器之力时将秘学士等级视为比正常高1。当你选择一天的灵器时，你可以改变身体的灵器学派。"
