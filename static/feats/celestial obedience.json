    "url": "https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Celestial%20Obedience",
    "source": ["Chronicle of the Righteous pg. 5"],
    "text": "Your reverence for an empyreal lord is so great that daily prayer and minor sacrifices grant you special boons.",
    "prerequisites": "Knowledge (planes) 3 ranks, must worship an empyreal lord.",
    "benefit": "Each empyreal lord requires a different obedience, but all obediences take only 1 hour to perform. Once you’ve performed the obedience, you gain the benefit of a special ability or resistance as indicated in the “Obedience” entry for the empyreal lord.<br><br> If you have at least 12 Hit Dice, you also gain the first boon granted by your empyreal lord upon undertaking your obedience. If you have at least 16 Hit Dice, you also gain the empyreal lord’s second boon. If you have 20 Hit Dice or more, you also gain the empyreal lord’s third boon. Unless a specific duration or number of uses per day is listed, a boon’s effects are constant.<br><br> Mystery cultists (see page 48) gain access to these boons at lower levels as a benefit of their prestige class.<br><br> If you ever fail to perform a daily obedience, you lose all access to the benefits and boons granted by this feat until you next perform the obedience."
