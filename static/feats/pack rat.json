    "text": "You collect all sorts of things, and frequently lose and refind things you acquired.",
    "prerequisites": "Ratfolk.",
    "benefit": "Once per day, when confronted with a situation that calls for a particular mundane item, you happen to have such an item on your person. The item must cost no more than 25 gp plus 5 gp per level, and you must pay its cost when you “find” it (in other words, the money you thought you had on your person was actually the item). The item must be something you can easily carry—for example, if you are on foot and have only a backpack, you could not have a large iron cauldron. You can’t find magical items using this feat, nor can you have specific items, such as the key to a particular door. If you are stripped of your equipment or possessions, you lose the benefits of this feat until you have at least a day to resupply and acquire new items.",

    "benefit_zh": "每天一次，当你面临急需某一件普通物品的情况时，你可以在随身的收藏里马上找出它来。这件物品的价格不能高于25GP+5GP/你的每个等级，而且你需要为它“付钱”（你花钱买过它，只是大多数时候想不起来它在什么地方而已）。这件物品必须是某种易于你携带的道具——比如，如果你徒步行走并且只有一个背包，那么你不能掏出一口大铁锅。你不能使用该专长获得魔法物品，也不能获得某种特殊物品，比如某一扇门的钥匙。如果你脱光装备或者个人物品，那么你会失去该专长的好处，直至你再次拥有这些物品至少1天为止，来使你获得补给，用于“获取”新的物品。"
