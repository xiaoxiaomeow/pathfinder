    "text": "Your lack of sight enables you to strike your foes with uncanny precision.",
    "prerequisites": "Blinded Blade Style, Blind-Fight, Improved Blind-Fight, Perception 10 ranks.",
    "benefit": "While you are using Blinded Blade Style and you are blinded or unable to see, you do not need to succeed at Perception checks to pinpoint the location of creatures within reach of your melee weapon, or your unmodified reach if you are not wielding a melee weapon. This ability functions like blindsense, except creatures you cannot see do not gain total concealment against you. Having this feat counts as having 15 ranks in Perception for the purpose of satisfying the prerequisites of the Greater Blind-Fight feat, as well as any feat that lists Greater Blind-Fight as a prerequisite.",

    "prerequisites_zh": "盲刃流，盲斗，精通盲斗，察觉10级。",
    "benefit_zh": "当你使用盲刃流且目盲或不可视物时，你不需要通过成功的察觉检定就能定位处在你近战武器触及范围内的生物，或是天然触及范围——如果你未持有近战武器的话。除了看不见的生物在对抗你时不会获得全隐蔽之外，此能力如同盲感Blindsense。在选择高等盲斗Greater Blind-FightAPG或基于高等盲斗为先决条件的专长时，拥有本专长视为满足察觉15级的先决条件。"
