    "prerequisites": "Dex 13, Int 13, Dodge, Mobility, Point-Blank Shot, Shot on the Run, base attack bonus +4, Use Magic Device 1 rank.",
    "benefit": "As a standard action, you can curse a creature you’ve dealt damage to with a ranged weapon attack since the beginning of your last turn. The target must succeed at a Reflex save, or you don’t take penalties on ranged weapon attacks against the creature for the first range increment and you ignore any bonus to the creature’s Armor Class from cover. The creature still benefits from total cover. This effect lasts for 1 minute.",
    "special": "A shaman or witch with this blood hex can use it against a target she has damaged with any ranged attack since her last turn, and applies its benefits to any ranged attack she makes against an affected creature.",

    "special_zh": "拥有该血巫术的萨满或女巫能对自他上一轮开始以来被他用远程攻击伤害过的生物使用这个血巫术，并将该巫术的好处应用到他对被影响生物作出的任何远程攻击。"
