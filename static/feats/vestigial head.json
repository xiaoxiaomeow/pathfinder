    "url": "https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Vestigial%20Head",
    "source": ["Monster Codex pg. 153"],
    "text": "You were born with a parasitic vestigial head with its own stunted brain. The head may be mostly subsumed within your own flesh and visible only as a distorted face, or it might sprout out of its own neck from your neck, shoulder, back, or chest.",
    "prerequisites": "Ogre.",
    "benefit": "Anytime you must attempt a Will save against a hostile effect, there is a 25% change that the effect targets your vestigial head instead. If this occurs, you are treated as if you had succeeded at your saving throw, and instead are sickened for 1d4 rounds or the duration of the effect (whichever is longer).",
    "special": "You can take this feat twice. The second time you do, the chance of a hostile Will effect targeting your vestigial head instead of your own increases to 50%. This doesn’t give you another vestigial head.",
    "name_zh": "头颅畸胎",
    "text_zh": "你的身体中有一个尚未发育完全的头颅（和同样残缺的大脑），这个畸胎可能只是你的皮肤上一个凸出，略带五官的鼓包，也可能是从你的脖子，背后或是肩膀上冒出来的半成型的脑袋。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "食人魔。",
    "benefit_zh": "每当你需要为一次有害效果进行意志豁免检定时，这个效果都有25%个概率作用在你的畸胎脑袋上而不是你自己身上。在这种情况下你视为成功的通过了意志检定，但会因此而在该效果的持续时间内处于恶心状态，或是恶心1d4轮，取其长者。",
    "special_zh": "你可以选择本专长最多两次，当你再次选择本专长时，你的畸胎头颅吸收有害效果的概率上升到50%，但你无法获得另一颗畸胎头颅。"
