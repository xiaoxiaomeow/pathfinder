    "benefit": "As a swift action, you can call upon your deity to guide an attack you make with your deity’s favored weapon. On your next attack in that round with that weapon, your weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction or striking an incorporeal creature. If your attack misses because of concealment, you can reroll your miss chance one time to see whether you actually hit.",

    "staminaText_zh": "当你使用这个专长时，你可以消耗5点耐力来选定一件并非你神祇偏好武器的武器。你在这件武器上获得这个专长的好处，直到你的下一回合开始。"
