    "text": "Your holy power burns the undead like fire.",
    "prerequisites": "Turn Undead, channel positive energy class feature.",
    "benefit": "When you use your Turn Undead feat, undead failing their saving throw are engulfed in holy fire. This functions identically to catching on fire (<i>Core Rulebook<\/i> 444), but the damage dealt is divine (like the divine damage from <i>flame strike<\/i>) rather than fire. Water cannot extinguish this holy fire, but any negative energy effect that heals the creature of at least 5 points of damage extinguishes the flames instantly.",
