    "text": "Thrown weapons fly from your hands as if blown by a gale, and you leave behind a wake of wind as you move.",
    "prerequisites": "Dex 13; Wis 13; Dodge; Mobility; Perfect Style; Quick Draw; Unfolding Wind Strike; base attack bonus +13 or monk level 13th.",
    "benefit": "When using Perfect Style and wielding thrown weapons, you can combine a full-attack action with a single move action. You must forgo the attack at your highest bonus but can take the remaining attacks as normal at any point during your movement. You can spend 1 ki point as a swift action to create a path of wind along your path of movement that functions as <i>wind wall<\/i> for 1 round; this effect does not affect your ranged attacks.",

    "benefit_zh": "若你正在使用无瑕流而且持用投掷武器，那么你能够将全力攻击和单个移动动作相结合。你必须放弃最高加值的那次攻击，但是可以在你移动的任意一点如常做出剩余的攻击。你能够以迅捷动作花费1点气，以此来沿着你移动的路径造出一道风，这被视为风墙术，持续1轮；该效果不会影响你的远程攻击。",
    "staminaText_zh": "你可以在使用八风流转时消耗2点耐力而不是1点气。"
