    "prerequisites": "Intimidate 5 ranks, tiefling.",
    "benefit": "Whenever you successfully demoralize an outsider of the evil subtype with an Intimidate check, it becomes sickened for 1 round in addition to being affected by the normal effects of being demoralized. If you beat the DC by 5 or more, the creature is nauseated for 1 round instead.",

    "benefit_zh": "当你成功使用威吓检定挫败邪恶子类的异界生物的士气时，目标除了受到挫败士气的正常影响以外，还会恶心1轮。如果你的检定高于DC5点或更多的话，该生物则会反胃1轮以取代恶心效果。",
    "normal_zh": "以成功的威吓检定挫败敌人的士气会使其颤栗1轮，检定每比DC高5点则会额外增加1轮。"
