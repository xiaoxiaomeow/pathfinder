    "text": "With practiced ease, you answer a blow with a blow. Even when you are overwhelmed, your body deflects the force of the strike back to the attacker as a stunning wave of energy.",
    "prerequisites": "Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, Linnorm Style, Linnorm Vengeance, base attack bonus +9 or monk level 9th.",
    "benefit": "When you use the Linnorm Vengeance feat to allow an enemy to hit you, you can make a retaliatory unarmed strike attack against that opponent as an immediate action. This acts as an attack of opportunity, and counts against the number of attacks of opportunity you can make each round. Additionally, once per day when a melee attack deals enough damage to knock you unconscious or kill you, the attacker must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier) or be stunned for 1 round. This save occurs after you make the retaliatory unarmed strike granted by the Linnorm Vengeance feat.",

    "prerequisites_zh": "感知13，精通徒手打击，蛇龙流，蛇龙复仇，BAB+9或9级武僧等级。",
    "benefit_zh": "当你用蛇龙复仇专长来让敌人击中你时，你可以用一个直觉动作对敌人进行徒手攻击作为反击。这相当于是一次借机攻击，并计入你每轮可进行的借机攻击次数。另外，每天一次，当受到一个足以让你昏迷或者死亡的近战攻击伤害时，攻击者必须成功通过强韧豁免（DC=10+1/2你的角色等级+感知调整）否则震慑1轮。这个豁免在你用蛇龙复仇专长进行报复性徒手攻击之后。"
