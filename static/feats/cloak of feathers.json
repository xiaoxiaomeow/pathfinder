    "url": "https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Cloak%20of%20Feathers",
    "source": ["Inner Sea Monster Codex pg. 53"],
    "text": "You have learned to blend in with wingless humanoids, and as long as you are not flying, you can fold your wings in a manner that resembles a cloak or robe.",
    "prerequisites": "Cha 13, strix.",
    "benefit": "When you fold your wings, you gain a +2 bonus on Disguise checks to pose as a human, and ignore the penalties for disguising yourself as a different race while doing so. Additionally, you can hide one small item within your wings’ folds (such as a potion, a wand, a weapon weighing 1 pound or less, or a similarly sized item at your GM’s discretion). Any such hidden item requires a successful DC 25 Perception check for others to notice. You can retrieve this item with a swift action, but unfolding your wings causes it to drop to the ground.",
    "special": "Other creatures with natural wings can also take Cloak of Feathers at the GM's discretion, ignoring the racial prerequisite"
