    "text": "You have learned to access preparation rituals from spellbooks from which you canâ€™t otherwise benefit.",
    "prerequisites": "Knowledge (arcana) 1 rank, Linguistics 1 rank, Spellcraft 1 rank, ability to cast read magic.",
    "benefit": "You can treat spellbooks with preparation rituals as if they were prayer books or meditation books.",
    "special": "A character with this feat can take the Avid Spellbook Reader feat even if she does not meet its prerequisites. Doing so allows her to benefit from the preparation rituals from two spellbooks, though she must still sacrifice spell slots to benefit from preparation rituals when treating such books as meditation books."
