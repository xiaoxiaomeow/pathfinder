    "url": "https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Changeling%20Familiar",
    "source": ["Wilderness Origins pg. 21"],
    "text": "Many familiars are able to turn into other animals, but a few familiars have greater talents, and can transform into humanoid bodies of their own.",
    "prerequisites": "Familiar class feature, caster level 9th, your familiar must have the change shape universal monster ability.",
    "benefit": "Your familiar’s change shape universal monster ability can function as <i>alter self<\/i>, and it gains a single alternate form of either Small or Medium size. This form is of a child or teenager of its master’s species, and once chosen cannot be changed. Such changeling familiars always bear some kind of visible mark of their original nature, such as a cat’s eyes, a serpent’s tongue, or small demonic horns. The changeling familiar does not gain any new languages with this transformation, so changeling familiars are often mute.",
    "name_zh": "化形魔宠",
    "text_zh": "许多魔宠能将自己变形成其他的动物，但只有少数魔宠拥有更强的天赋，可以在类人形态和原始形态之间转换。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "魔宠职业能力，施法者等级9级，你的魔宠必须拥有改变外形通用怪物能力。",
    "benefit_zh": "你魔宠的改变外形能力可以像变身术(AlterSelf,CRB)一样运作，获得一种小型或中型类人生物的形态，一经选择便无法改变。这一形态下的魔宠将会是魔宠主人同种族的少年或孩童，但带有一些魔宠原始形态的特征——比如猫的眼睛，分叉的爬行类舌头，或者小小的恶魔角。魔宠并不会因为新形态而获得新的语言，所以很多化形魔宠都是哑巴。"
