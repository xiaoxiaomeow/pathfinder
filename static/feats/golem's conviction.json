    "prerequisites": "Improved Iron Will, Iron Will, base attack bonus +8.",
    "benefit": "When you fail a Will save against a mind-affecting effect that would cause you to lose control of your actions (such as <i>dominate person<\/i> or <i>hideous laughter<\/i>), you can instead opt to follow a rudimentary programming. For a number of rounds equal to half your level (minimum 1) you gain the staggered condition and must either attack a designated target within 60 feet or hold position. If you hold position, you take the total defense action instead of taking whatever action the mind-affecting effect would force you to take. If you choose to attack a target, you must either make a ranged attack, make a melee attack, or move closer to the designated target. If the mind-affecting effect has not been resolved by the time the effects of this feat end, then you are subject to the effect as normal.",
