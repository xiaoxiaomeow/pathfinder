    "text": "When brandishing a flag adorned with the standard of an organization you owe allegiance to, you inspire nearby members of the same allegiance.",
    "prerequisites": "Cha 15.",
    "benefit": "As long as you hold your clan, house, or party’s flag (see page 293), members of that allegiance within 30 feet who can see the flag (including yourself ) gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and saving throws against fear and charm effects. You must hold the flag in one hand in order to grant this bonus. If the standard is taken by the enemy or destroyed, this bonus becomes a penalty, affecting all creatures that the bonus previously affected for 1 hour (or until you reclaim the lost flag).",

    "staminaText_zh": "当你可以看到你的旗帜但你并未握住它时，你可以消耗1点耐力来获得旗手的好处，就如同你已经握住旗帜了一样。"
