    "benefit": "You initiate this feat whenever you throw a splash weapon into a square within the reach of an ally who also has this feat and miss your target. Rather than you rolling to see where the weapon lands, the abettor can try to redirect it as an immediate action by making a melee touch attack against any adjacent foe. If the abettor’s attack hits that foe, the splash weapon impacts in the nearest square the targeted foe occupies.",

    "benefit_zh": "当你使用溅射武器失手打格子且此格子在一个同样拥有此专长的盟友触及范围内时，你可以激活此专长。牺牲者可以用直觉动作进行一次对临近敌人的近战接触攻击来改变此溅射武器的方向以取代溅射武器的随机掉落位置。如果牺牲者成功击中敌人，溅射武器会在目标敌人占据的格子最近的格子掉落。"
