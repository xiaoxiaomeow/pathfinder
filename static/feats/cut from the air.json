    "prerequisites": "Str 13, Power Attack, base attack bonus +5, weapon training class feature with a melee weapon.",
    "benefit": "When a ranged attack is made against you or a target adjacent to you, you can cut the weapon (or ammunition) out of the air, deflecting the attack so the target takes no damage. As an attack of opportunity, make a melee attack roll at your highest bonus. If the result is greater than the attack roll total of the ranged attack, the attack is deflected. You must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as boulders or ballista bolts) and ranged attacks generated by spell effects cannot be deflected.",

    "benefit_zh": "当你或一个邻接你的目标受到一次远程攻击时，，你可以将来袭的武器（或投射物）击落以避免避免受到伤害。你使用自己最高的攻击加值进行一次近战借机攻击，如果你的攻击检定结果高于这次远程攻击检定的结果，该次攻击被挡下。你必须可以意识到这次攻击的发出，并且并未处于措手不及状态才能尝试挡下这次攻击。通常大型远程武器（例如巨石或弩炮巨矢）和法术效果造成的远程攻击无法被挡开。"
