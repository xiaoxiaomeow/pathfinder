    "text": "You can ricochet a firearm shot off the wall and still hit your target.",
    "prerequisites": "Grit class feature or Amateur Gunslinger feat, Blind-Fight.",
    "benefit": "You can fire a shot at a wall or piece of solid terrain, and have it ricochet off. When you do, use the square immediately in front of the wall or piece of solid terrain to determine line of sight to a target, and this square is considered the new origin square of the attack. Use that square to determine the effects of cover, and your own square to determine the effects of concealment. You can make this shot as long as you have at least 1 grit point. When making this shot, you can spend 1 grit point to ignore the effects of all cover or concealment. You must choose to spend the grit point before you make the attack roll.",

    "prerequisites_zh": "【勇毅】职业特性或业余铳士专长，盲战。",
    "benefit_zh": "你可以对一面墙壁或一块固体地面射击，使其反弹。当你这么做时，使用正在那面墙前面的方格，或那块地面的方格来决定对目标的视线，而这个方格将被视为发起攻击的起点方格。以那个方格决定掩蔽效果，而以你所在的方格决定隐蔽效果。你可以在有至少1点勇毅点时进行这样的射击。当这么射击时，你可以消耗1点勇毅点忽略所有掩蔽和遮蔽的效果。你必须在检定前选择是否消耗勇毅点。"
