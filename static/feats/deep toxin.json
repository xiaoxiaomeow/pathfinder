    "prerequisites": "Vital Strike; base attack bonus +6; Craft (poison) 6 ranks or poison use class feature.",
    "benefit": "When you use a poisoned weapon to make a Vital Strike, you increase the poison’s duration by one frequency increment (for example, a dose of large scorpion venom would last for 7 rounds instead of 6 and a dose of drow poison would last for 3 minutes instead of 2). The poison takes effect immediately and does not have an onset time.",
