    "text": "You gain the powers of undeath when you feed upon their kind.",
    "prerequisites": "Nabasu, Con 23",
    "benefit": "As a full-round action, you can consume the animating force of any undead creature you have created with your death-stealing gaze. This immediately destroys the undead creature, but grants you one of that creatureâ€™s special attacks or supernatural abilities (chosen from one of the following abilities possessed by the undead: Constitution drain, disease, energy drain, or paralysis). The ability granted persists for 24 hours or until the next sunrise, whichever comes first."
