    "text": "You can sacrifice arcane spells or spell slots in order to make it harder to resist your jinxes.",
    "prerequisites": "Arcane spellcaster, Halfling Jinx trait.",
    "benefit": "When you attempt to jinx a creature, you can expend one of your prepared arcane spells or available arcane spell slots to give your target a penalty on its jinx save equal to the level of the expended spell or spell slot. This does not alter the effect of the jinx, only the saving throw to resist the jinx."
