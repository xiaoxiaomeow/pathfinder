    "prerequisites": "Improved Unarmed Strike, Power Attack, Tiger Claws, Tiger Style, base attack bonus +9 or monk level 8th.",
    "benefit": "While using the Tiger Style feat, you can apply the penalty from Power Attack to your AC instead of attack rolls. Additionally, once per round as a swift action, you can move up to half your speed closer to a target you hit with an unarmed strike or made a successful combat maneuver against on this turn or your last turn.",

    "staminaText": "When using Tiger Style, you can spend 2 stamina points and take a swift action to move closer to an enemy you’ve hit with an unarmed strike or made a successful combat maneuver against at any point during this combat, instead of one you hit on this or your last turn.",

    "staminaText_zh": "当你使用虎形拳UC时，你可以消耗2点耐力以一个迅捷动作来向一个你在这场战斗中而不是你在该轮或者上一轮使用徒手击打命中或者对其成功使用了一次战技的敌人移动。"
