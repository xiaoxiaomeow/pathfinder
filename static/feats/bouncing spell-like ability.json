    "text": "You can retarget one of your spell-like abilities when it fails to affect its original target.",
    "prerequisites": "Spell-like ability at caster level 4th or higher.",
    "benefit": "Choose one of your spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a bouncing spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).<br><br> Whenever you use a bouncing spell-like ability against a single target and the ability has no effect on it (whether due to spell resistance or a successful saving throw), as a swift action, you can redirect the spell-like ability to target another eligible creature within range. The redirected spell-like ability behaves as if its new target were the original target for the spell-like ability. Spell-like abilities that affect a target in any way (including a lesser effect from a successful saving throw) can’t be redirected in this manner.<br><br> You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) – 1. For a summary, see Table 3–1.",
    "special": "This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.<br><br><table class=\"inner\"><tr><td>"
