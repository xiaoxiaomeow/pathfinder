    "text": "You move with uncommon grace that disorients enemies, causing foes that strike at you to overreach and stumble.",
    "prerequisites": "Agile Maneuvers, Azata Style, Dodge, Mobility, base attack bonus +6.",
    "benefit": "While using Azata Style, whenever an opponent misses you with an attack of opportunity provoked by your movement through its threatened squares, you can attempt a trip combat maneuver against that creature at the end of your turn as a swift action, provided you are still adjacent to the creature when you end your movement for the round. This trip attempt does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You gain a bonus on your combat maneuver check equal to any bonuses to AC you gain against attacks of opportunity provoked by movement (such as that granted by the Mobility feat).",

    "benefit_zh": "使用爱塔之型时，当一个敌人在因你在威胁范围内移动而引起的借机攻击中失手时，如果你本回合移动结束后仍与该生物相邻，你可以在回合结束时以一个迅捷动作尝试对该生物发动一次绊摔战技。这次绊摔战技不会引起借机攻击。你在该战技检定上获得加值，等于你对抗因移动而导致借机攻击时获得的所有AC加值（例如由灵活移动Mobility专长提供的加值）。"
