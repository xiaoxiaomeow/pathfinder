    "text": "When you engage in unarmed combat, you know just where to strike to stagger your foe.",
    "prerequisites": "Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +2.",
    "benefit": "When you damage a foe with your unarmed attack, you can also cause it to be staggered for 1 round (until just before your next turn). The target can avoid this with a successful Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier). You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll; thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt. You can attempt to use this feat once per day for every 4 character levels you have, but no more than once per round. Constructs, incorporeal creatures, plants, undead, and creatures that are immune to critical hits cannot be affected by this ability.",

    "prerequisites_zh": "敏捷13，感知13，精通徒手击打，BAB+2。",
    "benefit_zh": "你必须在投掷攻击骰之前宣告使用此专长（因此，未命中会导致尝试失败）。恍惚拳在正常造成伤害的同时，还会强制受到你徒手击打伤害的敌人进行一次DC=10+1/2你的角色等级+感知调整值的强韧豁免检定。豁免检定失败的防御者将恍惚1轮。每4级你每天可以多尝试一次取力攻击，每轮不能超过1次。构装、泥怪、植物、不死、虚体生物和免疫重击的生物不会被本能力影响。",
    "staminaText_zh": "你可以消耗5点耐力来在你的徒手击打命中后宣告使用这个专长。"
