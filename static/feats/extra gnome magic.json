    "text": "The raw magic that flows through your gnome blood is stronger than normal.",
    "prerequisites": "Cha 13, Gnome.",
    "benefit": "You gain an additional three uses per day of your gnome spell-like abilities (<i>dancing lights<\/i>, <i>ghost sound<\/i>, <i>prestidigitation<\/i>). You can use these in any combination; for example, you can use <i>dancing lights<\/i> four times in one day (taking all three additional uses for the same spell), or you can cast <i>ghost sound<\/i> twice, <i>prestidigitation<\/i> twice, <i>speak with animals<\/i> twice, and <i>dancing lights<\/i> once. If you have a feat, trait, or other ability that changes your racial 0-level spell-like abilities to other 0-level spells, this feat applies to them instead."
