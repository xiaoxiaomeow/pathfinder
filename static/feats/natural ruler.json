    "source": ["Quests and Campaigns pg. 27"],
    "text": "You have a special talent for ruling a nation, and take to the task with ease.",
    "prerequisites": "Hold a leadership role related to running a kingdom.",
    "benefit": "Choose an ability score. Any time your leadership role calls for that ability score to affect one of your kingdom’s attributes, your modifier to that ability score is treated as being +2 higher. For example, if you choose Charisma and occupy the General or High Priest leadership role, your Charisma modifier to affect your kingdom’s stability would be +2 higher than normal. However, if you occupied the Spymaster leadership role—which employs the Intelligence and Wisdom ability scores—this feat would grant no benefit.<br><br> Additionally, the entire kingdom gains +2 Stability for as long as you occupy a leadership role.",
    "special": "You may gain this feat multiple times, but each time you must choose a different ability score. The bonus to Stability gained from this feat stacks."
