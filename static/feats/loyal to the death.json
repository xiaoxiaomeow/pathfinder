    "benefit": "Whenever an opponent makes a melee or ranged attack against one of your allies who is adjacent to you and who also has this feat, you can spend an immediate action to shield the ally with your own body. You become the target of the attack, and the opponent gains a +4 bonus on her attack roll. For the purpose of determining distance, cover and concealment, you count as being in your ally’s square when the attack is resolved. If the attack misses you due to concealment, blink, or a similar effect, it instead targets your ally as if you had not used this feat’s ability.",

    "text_zh": "你对于家人或朋友无比忠实，你为他们承担伤痛不会有一丝悔恨。",

    "benefit_zh": "当敌人对一个同样拥有此专长并与你邻接的盟友发动一次近程或远程攻击时，你可以花一个直觉动作来用你自己身体来保护你的盟友。你会成为此次攻击的目标，同时对手在她的攻击骰上获得+4加值。在计算距离，隐蔽和掩蔽时，你被视为处于你盟友的方格中。如果这次攻击由于由于隐蔽，闪现，或类似的效果而未命中，那么你的盟友会重新成为此次攻击的目标，如同你未使用此专长。"
