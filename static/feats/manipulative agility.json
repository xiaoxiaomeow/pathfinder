    "source": ["Ultimate Intrigue pg. 86"],
    "text": "You can use your agility to manipulate people as well as small objects.",
    "prerequisites": "Bluff 1 rank, Sleight of Hand 1 rank.",
    "benefit": "You can use Sleight of Hand in place of Bluff for checks to feint in combat, as well as for checks to pass secret messages without being noticed (by using gestures and body language). In both cases, the effects become visual and don’t work if the target or recipient is blind or cannot see you. In the case of secret messages, the limitations of hand gestures and body language might impact what sorts of messages you can pass, at the GM’s discretion.",
    "name_zh": "灵巧手技",
    "text_zh": "你那双灵巧的手可以像摆弄小物件一般控制他人。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "唬骗1级，巧手1级。",
    "benefit_zh": "你能够在战斗中进行虚招的检定以及在不引起注意的传递密语检定中，使用巧手替代唬骗（通过使用手势和肢体动作）。在这两种情况下，检定效果都会变为视觉（visual）效果，而且如果目标或接收密语的对象目盲（blind）或者无法看到你，检定便无法生效。在传递密语的情况下，依照GM的判断，手语和肢体语言带来的局限性可能会影响你所能传递的信息种类。"
