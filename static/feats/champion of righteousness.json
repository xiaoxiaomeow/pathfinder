    "descriptors": ["Alignment"],
    "source": ["Pathfinder Unchained pg. 99"],
    "text": "You know that good must be tempered with order if itâ€™s going to prevail in the long term.",
    "prerequisites": "10 Hit Dice, lawful good alignment.",
    "benefit": "You can store a number of affirmations up to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1) to use at any time, not just within the next 24 hours. You can use an affirmation to treat the effect of a spell, magic item, or other alignment-based effect on you as if you were neither lawful nor good. You can choose to do so after any attack roll hits you with such an effect or you fail a saving throw against such an effect. Lastly, you gain a +2 bonus on weapon and spell damage rolls against chaotic and evil creatures (or +4 if the creature is both chaotic and evil). This is an alignment-based effect."
