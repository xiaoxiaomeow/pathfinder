    "prerequisites": "Stealthy.",
    "benefit": "When triggering a wand, staff or any other magic item, you can attempt a Stealth check (opposed by observers’ Perception checks) to conceal the trigger from onlookers. If the magic item produces an obvious effect (such as a summoned creature or visible spell effect), you take a –4 penalty on the Stealth check, and even if your check is successful, observers still see the spell effect (though they fail to notice you are responsible for it).",
