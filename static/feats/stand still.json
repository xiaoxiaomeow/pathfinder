    "text": "You can stop foes that try to move past you.",
    "prerequisites": "Combat Reflexes.",
    "benefit": "When a foe provokes an attack of opportunity due to moving through your adjacent squares, you can make a combat maneuver check as your attack of opportunity. If successful, the enemy cannot move for the rest of his turn. An enemy can still take the rest of his action, but cannot move. This feat also applies to any creature that attempts to move from a square that is adjacent to you if such movement provokes an attack of opportunity.",

    "staminaText": "When you succeed at a combat maneuver check to stop a creature’s movement with this feat, you can spend 5 stamina points. If you do, on that creature’s next turn, its movement speed is halved and it can’t take a 5-foot step.",

    "benefit_zh": "当一个敌人因经过你的邻近区域而触发借机攻击时，你可以做一次战技检定来做为借机攻击。如果成功，敌人在他回合的剩余部分内不能移动。敌人仍然可以做他动作的剩余部分，但就是不能移动。此专长也可应用于任何试图从你相邻区域移开的生物，如果该移动会触发借机攻击。",
    "staminaText_zh": "当你成功使用该专长以战技检定阻止了一个生物的移动时，你可以消耗5点耐力。如果你这样做了，在那个生物的下一回合，它的移动力将会减半，而且它将不能做出5尺快步。"
