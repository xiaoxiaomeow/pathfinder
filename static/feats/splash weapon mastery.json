    "source": ["Adventurer's Armory pg. 31"],
    "text": "You are adept at increasing the range, area, and accuracy of splash weapons.",
    "benefit": "When throwing a splash weapon, you act as if you had the Far Shot feat. When you hit with a splash weapon, select one additional square adjacent to the splash area; creatures in this area also take splash damage. When you miss with a splash weapon, you may adjust the miss direction on the grid by +1 or –1. This feat counts as Far Shot for the purpose of qualifying for other feats, but only in regard to splash weapons.",
    "name_zh": "溅射武器大师",
    "text_zh": "你擅长于提高溅射武器的射程、范围和精确度。",
    "benefit_zh": "当投掷溅射武器时，你可以如同拥有远距射击专长。当你使用溅射武器命中目标时，选择一个与溅射范围相邻的方格；此方格内的生物同样受到溅射伤害。当你投掷溅射武器失手时，你可以用+1或者-1来调整误落地点的方向。此专长在决定其他专长的先决条件时视为远距射击，但是仍旧只对溅射武器有效。"
