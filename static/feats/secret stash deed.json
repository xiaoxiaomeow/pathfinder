    "url": "https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Secret%20Stash%20Deed",
    "descriptors": ["Grit"],
    "source": ["Ultimate Combat pg. 116"],
    "text": "You are so skilled at stashing small packets of firearm ammunition and black powder on your person that you sometimes surprise yourself when you find them. ",
    "prerequisites": "Grit class feature or Amateur Gunslinger feat, Sleight of Hand 1 rank.",
    "benefit": "Spend 1 grit point while in combat to recover either 1 bullet and 1 dose of black powder or 1 alchemical cartridge from a hidden stash on your person that you had, until now, forgotten about. If the bullet and black powder or the alchemical cartridges are normal shot, you do not need to pay for the ammunition. If you want to recover any other kind of ammunition, you must pay for it with gold pieces from your character’s wealth. The grit cost of this deed cannot be decreased by the Signature Deed feat, the true grit class feature, or any other similar effect that reduces the number of grit points you spend to use a deed. You also gain a +4 bonus on any Sleight of Hand checks made while gambling.",
    "name_zh": "未雨绸缪",
    "text_zh": "你如此擅长于把小包的弹药和黑火药藏在身上，有时候你甚至会在你找到它们时感到吃惊。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "【勇毅】职业特性或业余铳士专长，巧手1级。",
    "benefit_zh": "在战斗中，消耗1点勇毅点，在你身上某个隐蔽的地方，恢复一份子弹和一份黑火药、或是一发炼金子弹，即使你直到现在都忘记了其存在。如果那份子弹、黑火药、或是炼金子弹是普通货，你不需要掏钱。如果你要恢复其他种类的弹药，你必须从你的角色的财产中支付其价格。这个铳技的勇毅点数消耗不能被“招牌动作”专长，“纯正勇毅”职业特性，或任何能减少你勇毅点数消耗的类似效果所减少。你在赌博时的任何巧手检定都获得+4加值。"
