    "benefit": "While using the aid another action to improve an adjacent ally’s AC, you can intercept a successful attack against that ally as an immediate action, taking full damage from that attack and any associated effects (bleed, poison, etc.). A creature cannot benefit from this feat more than once per attack.",

    "staminaText": "When using this feat’s benefit, you can spend up to 5 stamina points to reduce the damage from the intercepted attack by an amount equal to double the number of stamina points you spent this way. This does not alter other effects from that attack (such as bleed, poison, etc.), even if the damage is reduced to 0.",

    "benefit_zh": "当你使用援助他人动作提高相邻盟友的AC时，你能够以直觉动作拦截对抗该名盟友的成功攻击，受到该次攻击的全部伤害以及任何可能的效果（流血，毒素等等）。一名生物从该专长获得的好处不能超过每次攻击一回。【编注：就是说不能由多人同时来为同一人挡刀。】",
    "staminaText_zh": "当你使用这个专长的效果时，你可以消耗5点耐力来降低被拦截攻击的伤害，降低的点数等于两倍你以这种方式消耗的耐力。这不会改变其它来自这次攻击的效果（比如流血，毒素等等），即使伤害已经降低到0。"
