    "text": "You abandon all notion of personal space when in danger, scurrying about your allies in search of the best vantage point from which to strike at your foes.",
    "prerequisites": "Ratfolk, swarming racial trait.",
    "benefit": "You can use your swarming racial trait to enter the square of any willing ally that is the same size as you or up to one size category larger, granting you the benefits of the swarming racial trait as if your ally were also a ratfolk with the swarming racial trait. Your ally gains no benefits from sharing its space with you unless it also has the swarming racial trait. Additionally, you treat any ally who shares its space with you as having the same teamwork feats that you do for the purpose of determining whether you gain a bonus from teamwork feats. Your ally doesn’t gain any of the bonuses from these feats unless she actually has the teamwork feats. You and your ally’s positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisites listed in a teamwork feat’s description in order to gain the teamwork feat’s listed bonus, but your ally is considered to be adjacent to you while you share her space for the purpose of determining whether you or your ally gains a benefit."
