    "text": "You have read the texts of the perfect way, and know how identify to your enemies’ weak spot. ",
    "prerequisites": "Int 13, Kirin Style, Improved Unarmed Strike, Knowledge (arcana) 9 ranks, Knowledge (dungeoneering, local, nature, planes, or religion) 3 ranks.",
    "benefit": "You gain a +2 insight bonus on Knowledge checks made to identify creatures, including the one Kirin Style allows. While using Kirin Style against a creature you have identified using that feat, as a swift action after you have hit a creature with a melee or ranged attack, you can add twice your Intelligence modifier in damage (minimum 2).",

    "staminaText": "As long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool, when you hit a creature you have identified with Kirin Style, you add your Intelligence modifier to melee and ranged attack damage rolls against that creature for the next 24 hours. You still can take a swift action to add twice your Intelligence modifier to damage rolls, but that damage doesn’t stack with the damage from this combat trick.",

    "staminaText_zh": "只要你在你的耐力池中还拥有至少1点耐力，当你击中一个你用麒麟势鉴定过的生物时，你可以在之后的24小时将你的智力调整值加到对抗那个生物的近战和远程伤害骰上。你可以以一个迅捷动作将两倍智力调整值加到伤害骰上，但不会与来自这个战策的伤害叠加。"
