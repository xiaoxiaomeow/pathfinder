    "prerequisites": "Wisdom 13, alignment must match that of your worshiped deity.",
    "benefit": "Once per day as a swift action, you can ponder whether or not your deity would approve or disapprove of a particular course of action, and whether that action would impact your alignment. The GM decides if the action is one your deity would approve of, and if it is, you gain an insight bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1) on any d20 roll made in association with that action during this round. For every 3 ranks you have in Knowledge (religion), you can use this ability an additional time per day, to a maximum of 6 times a day.",

    "text_zh": "你与神祇存在紧密且私密的个人联系，这使你能够洞悉他或她的意愿。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "感知13，与信仰神祇阵营一致。",
    "benefit_zh": "每日一次以迅捷行动，你可以思考你的神祇是否会赞成或反对某一特定行动，以及该行动是否会影响你的阵营。GM决定该行动是否是你的信仰神祇所认可的，若是，则你在本轮中进行的任何与该行动相关的D20检定中获得等同于你感知修正（最低+1）的洞察加值。你在宗教知识上每有3级，每日可以额外使用一次该能力，至多每日6次。"
