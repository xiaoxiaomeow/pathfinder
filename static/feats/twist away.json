    "text": "Your quick reflexes and dexterous movements make up for your lack of stamina.",
    "prerequisites": "Evasion.",
    "benefit": "While you are wearing light armor or no armor, if you are forced to attempt a Fortitude saving throw, you can use an immediate action to instead attempt a Reflex saving throw (at the same DC). If you succeed at this saving throw and the attack has a reduced effect on a successful save, you avoid the effect entirely. Whether the saving throw is successful or not, you are staggered until the end of your next turn. If you are prevented from becoming staggered, you can't use Twist Away, nor can you ignore the staggered condition from Twist Away or remove it early.",

    "text_zh": "你拥有让他人希望暂停学习的神姿势，足以规避最猛最恶的打击。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "反射闪避。",
    "benefit_zh": "当你着轻甲或不着甲时，每当你需要进行一个强韧豁免检定，你都可以以一个直觉动作，进行一次反射豁免检定（使用相同的DC）作为检定结果。如果你的豁免检定成功且正常情况下可以减免一部分该能力的效果，那么你可以完全避免整个效果。无论你是否成功通过豁免检定，你都会在下一轮陷入恍惚状态。如果你不会陷入恍惚，你就无法使用该专长。你也不能忽视该专长的恍惚效果，也无法提前解除它。"
