    "source": ["Guardians of Dragonfall pg. 29"],
    "text": "You have mastered a technique that allows you to release your breath weapon as you bite an opponent.",
    "prerequisites": "Breath weapon, true dragon.",
    "benefit": "You may expend your breath weapon in a continuous way, such that any successful bite attack also deals your breath weapon damage (no save). The slow exhalation of your breath weapon may be maintained for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution bonus if your breath weapon is cone-shaped, or half that duration if it is line-shaped. Once you complete your slow exhalation, you must wait 1d4 rounds as normal before using your breath weapon again."
