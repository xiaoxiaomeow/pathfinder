    "text": "Your natural knack for illusion allows you to maintain at least one illusion spell with little effort.",
    "prerequisites": "Gnome.",
    "benefit": "You can maintain concentration on one spell of the illusion school as a swift action. This has no effect on spells of other schools or on illusion spells with durations that donâ€™t depend on your active concentration. While you may only maintain one spell as a swift action, you may take your move and standard actions to maintain other spells normally, if you wish.",
    "normal": "Concentrating to maintain a spell is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity."
