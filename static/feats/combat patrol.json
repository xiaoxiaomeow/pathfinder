    "prerequisites": "Combat Reflexes, Mobility, base attack bonus +5.",
    "benefit": "As a full-round action, you may set up a combat patrol, increasing your threatened area by 5 feet for every 5 points of your base attack bonus. Until the beginning of your next turn, you may make attacks of opportunity against any opponent in this threatened area that provokes attacks of opportunity. You may move as part of these attacks, provided your total movement before your next turn does not exceed your speed. Any movement you make provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.",

    "staminaText": "When moving before or after making an attack of opportunity while using Combat Patrol, you can spend 1 stamina point per 5 feet moved. When you do, that movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.",

    "benefit_zh": "以整轮动作，你能够进行战斗戒备，每拥有5点BAB，你的威胁范围就能够增加5尺。直至你的下一轮开始为止，你能够对处于威胁范围内并且引起借机攻击的敌人进行借机攻击。作为这些攻击的一部分，你能够进行移动，只要到你的下一轮开始之前移动的总距离不超过你的速度即可。任何由你进行的移动会如常引起借机攻击。",
    "staminaText_zh": "使用战斗戒备时，每次发起借机攻击并随之移动时，为每5尺移动距离花费1点耐力，就能免于被敌人借机攻击。"
