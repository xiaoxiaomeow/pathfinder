    "text": "You are comfortable in the driving snow and glaring ice of frigid climes, and you can survive much longer in such harsh environments than those who are unaccustomed to the cold.",
    "prerequisites": "Favored terrain (cold) class feature.",
    "benefit": "You treat cold environments (<i>Core Rulebook 442<\/i>) as though they were one step less severe than they normally are. Additionally, you gain a +2 bonus on Perception checks against creatures that gain a racial bonus on Stealth checks in snowy conditions, and you gain a +4 bonus on saving throws and checks to avoid becoming blinded or dazzled by ice or snow glare."
