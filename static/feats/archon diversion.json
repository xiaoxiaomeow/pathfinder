    "text": "You throw yourself in front of blows meant for allies, giving those allies a chance to strike back against the enemy once they have attacked you.",
    "prerequisites": "Archon Style; Combat Expertise; Combat Reflexes; base attack bonus +4 or monk level 3rd.",
    "benefit": "The penalty to AC for using Archon Style to grant nearby allies a bonus to AC against a single opponent decreases to –1. Once per round while using Archon Style, when you have at least one hand free or when wielding a shield, you can divert one melee weapon attack targeting an adjacent ally to yourself. After resolving the attack, the ally you protected can make an attack of opportunity against the diverted opponent. You expend no action to divert the attack, but you must be aware of it and must not be flat-footed. You must choose to divert the attack after the opponent has declared the melee attack, but before the attack roll is rolled.",

    "benefit_zh": "当你使用神使之型为你邻接的盟友提供针对单个敌人的AC加值时，你自己的AC减值降为-1。此外在你使用神使之型时，每轮一次，当你至少有一只手空闲或持用盾牌时，你可以将针对相邻盟友的近战武器攻击转移到自己身上。结算这次攻击后，受你保护的盟友可以对攻击被转移的敌人进行借机攻击。你无需花费任何动作来转移攻击，但你必须察觉到该攻击，且不能处于措手不及状态。你必须在敌人宣布近战攻击之后、进行攻击检定之前选择转移攻击。"
