    "benefit": "You can take 10 on Bluff checks to convince others you are telling the truth, so long as your story makes you appear innocent. You gain a +2 bonus on Disguise skill checks to pose as a human child, and ignore the check penalties for disguising yourself as a different race and age category while doing so.",

    "benefit_zh": "只要你的故事能够显得自己是无辜的，就能够在唬骗检定中取10，用以让别人认为你说的是真话。你还在冒充为人类孩童的易容检定中获得+2加值，并且忽略在这么做时，易容为不同种族和不同年龄层的减值。"
