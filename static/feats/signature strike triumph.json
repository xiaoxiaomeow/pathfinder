    "benefit": "When you use Signature Strike Style to give a creature the shaken condition, increase the duration to 1d4+1 rounds. When you confirm a critical hit against a creature marked by your Signature Strike Style, one ally within 60 feet who can see you can attempt a new saving throw against one ongoing effect with the emotion, fear, or mind-affecting descriptor caused by the marked creature. If the ally succeeds at this saving throw and the effect’s remaining duration is 24 hours or less, the effect ends; if the remaining duration is more than 24 hours, the effect is suppressed for 1 minute.",
