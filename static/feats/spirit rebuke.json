    "text": "Your insight and force of will can tame dangerous spirits.",
    "prerequisites": "Wis 17; Iron Will; Spirit Beacon; Diplomacy 5 ranks or Intimidate 5 ranks.",
    "benefit": "Select one specific category of spirit (fey, outsiders, or undead). Once per day as a standard action, you can condemn these spirits with such force of will that you can drive them from hosts, unravel their magic, or damage them physically. A rebuke targets a single spirit you can see (or one that is possessing a creature you can see) within 30 feet.<br><br> Rebuking a spirit either functions as a targeted <i>dispel magic<\/i> spell or channels damaging energy directly into the creature, similar to a cleric’s channel energy ability. To dispel a spirit’s magic, attempt a dispel check, using your character level as your caster level (DC = 11 + spell level); if you’re successful, that effect is dispelled. You can dispel only spells and spell-like abilities affecting the spirit itself or a creature it is currently possessing. If you use this dispel effect to end a spirit’s possession of a creature or object, you gain a +2 bonus on this check. Channeling damaging energy instead deals 1d6 points of damage for every 2 character levels you have. A successful Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your character level + your Charisma modifier) halves this damage.",
    "special": "You can select this feat up to three times. Each time you do, you must select a different category of spirit your rebuke can affect, and you can use the feat one additional time each day.",
