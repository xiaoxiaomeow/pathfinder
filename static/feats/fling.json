    "source": ["Inner Sea Monster Codex pg. 53"],
    "text": "You can throw grappled enemies a short distance, turning them into makeshift missiles against their allies.",
    "prerequisites": "Flyby Attack, Powerful Wings, Snatch and Drop, Throw Anything.",
    "benefit": "Whenever you successfully grapple an opponent using the Snatch and Drop feat, you can instead fling your victim at another target. You can throw a creature 10 feet, plus an additional 5 feet for every size category by which it is smaller than you. To strike another target, make a ranged touch attack. If you hit, the attack deals damage to both the creature flung and its intended target. This damage is equal to that of a slam attack of a creature two sizes larger than the creature being flung (see page 302 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary<\/i>) plus your Strength modifier. The flung creature lands prone in the nearest adjacent square to the target, and the target must succeed at a Reflex saving throw (DC = 10 + damage dealt) or also fall prone in its own square. You canâ€™t use this feat if the weight of the creature you intend to fling exceeds the amount you can carry as a heavy load.",
    "special": "While the following feats are primarily taken by strix, other creatures with natural wings can also take them at the GM's discretion.",
