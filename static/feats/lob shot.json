    "prerequisites": "Far Shot, Point-Blank Shot.",
    "benefit": "While making a ranged attack, you can ignore any cover bonuses to AC, including total cover, unless the target also has cover from above, such as a roof or forest canopy. When using this feat, treat your target as if it were one range increment farther away. You can’t use this feat unless you have headroom equal to at least half the attack’s range.",

    "benefit_zh": "若你的目标没有正上方的掩蔽（比如屋顶或树穹），则你在对该目标进行远程攻击时可以忽视目标的掩蔽和全掩蔽所带来的AC。使用该专长时，目标会视为处于你的第一个射程增量外。若你头顶的净空高度小于你攻击射程的一半，则无法使用该专长。"
