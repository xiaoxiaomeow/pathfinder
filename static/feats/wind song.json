    "url": "https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Wind%20Song",
    "source": ["Elemental Master's Handbook pg. 19"],
    "text": "You have learned to play haunting, captivating melodies similar to those of the eerie Painted Flutes canyon. Like an echo, the wind carries the sound and magic of your music much farther than it would normally reach.",
    "prerequisites": "Perform (wind instruments) 5 ranks; bardic performance or raging song class feature.",
    "benefit": "Three times per day while you are using a wind instrument to play a bardic performance or raging song, you can spend an extra round of performance at the start of your performance and choose a square within 120 feet. Strange echoes carry your music, and for the purpose of determining which creatures are affected by your performance, your performance counts as originating from that square rather than from your location. You cannot change the square from which the music originates until you end your performance. If you move beyond 120 feet from the chosen square, the performance immediately ends.",
    "name_zh": "风之歌",
    "text_zh": "你已经学会了如何演奏类似于可怕的染笛峡谷中的那些难忘而动人的旋律。就像回声一样，风会把你的声音和魔法传递到更远。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "表演（吹奏乐）5级，吟游表演职业能力或是战怒之歌职业能力。",
    "benefit_zh": "每天3次，当你用吹奏乐器来开始进行吟游表演或者战怒之歌时，你可以选择额外消耗1轮表演轮数来选择一个在120尺内的方格。奇怪的回应会夹杂着你的音乐，并且来确定受你表演影响的生物，你的表演被视为来源于你选择的方格而不是你的位置。直到你表演结束，你都不能切换音乐源发的方格。如果你离选择的方格之间的距离超过了120尺，那么表演会立刻结束。"
