    "prerequisites": "Ride 1 rank, Mounted Combat.",
    "benefit": "When you attempt to overrun an opponent while mounted, your target may not choose to avoid you. Your mount may make one hoof attack against any target you knock down, gaining the standard +4 bonus on attack rolls against prone targets.",
    "staminaSource": "Pathfinder Unchained pg. 134",
    "staminaText": "When you attempt to overrun an opponent while mounted and you don’t succeed at the overrun combat maneuver check, you can spend 2 stamina points and continue to move as if the target of the overrun had moved out of the way.",

    "mythicText": "Your rearing mount can stomp foes into the ground, barely",
    "mythicPrerequisites": "Trample.",
    "mythicBenefit": "Your mount can make two hoof attacks against an opponent you knock down with an overrun, instead of one. You can expend one use of mythic power when you score a critical hit with one or more of those hoof attacks. When you do, the critical is automatically confirmed. If both scored critical hits, expending one use of mythic power automatically confirms both.",

    "prerequisites_zh": "骑术1级、骑乘战斗。",
    "benefit_zh": "若你骑乘坐骑时闯越对手，他将无法躲避。如果对手因而倒地，你的坐骑可以对他做一次蹄踢攻击。一般而言攻击倒地的目标，攻击检定有+4加值。",
    "mythicText_zh": "你驯养的坐骑能够使用双蹄践踏地上的敌人。",
    "mythicPrerequisites_zh": "践踏",
    "mythicBenefit_zh": "若敌人被你的闯越击倒，你的坐骑能够对他进行两次蹄击（hoof）攻击，以取代原本的1次。当这些蹄击攻击引起1次或更多次重击时，你能够花费1次神话之力。若你这么做，重击会自动确认。若两次都引起重击，花费1次神话之力会使两次都自动确认。",
    "staminaText_zh": "当你在骑乘时尝试闯越一个敌人并且你在闯越战技检定中并未成功时，你可以消耗2点耐力来继续移动，就如同被闯越的目标从你的路线中被移开了一样。"
