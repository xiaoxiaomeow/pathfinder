    "text": "Your deep strikes allow you to deliver poison efficiently when your opponent is off guard.",
    "prerequisites": "Sneak attack +2d6.",
    "benefit": "When you hit an opponent with a poisoned weapon and would deal sneak attack damage, you can choose to forgo some or all of the sneak attack damage to increase the poisonâ€™s chance of success. For every 2d6 points of sneak attack damage you forgo, add 1 to the saving throw DC of the poison delivered with your attack. This increase to the poison save DC does not apply to creatures that are immune to precision damage."
