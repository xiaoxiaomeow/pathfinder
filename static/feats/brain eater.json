    "text": "You gain some of the skills and knowledge of a consumed foe by eating its brain.",
    "prerequisites": "Ghoul, Int 17.",
    "benefit": "If you eat a portion of the brain of a creature with Intelligence 3 or higher, you gain a +2 insight bonus on all skill checks and Will saving throws for 1 hour. Eating a brain is a full-round action, and the target must be dead or helpless. If the target is living, you may attempt to eat its brain as a coup de grace attack on the target, but you gain the insight bonus only if your attempt results in the victimâ€™s death."
