    "text": "Death is no stranger to you, for you have risen from the grave to continue your quest many times.",
    "prerequisites": "Die and be brought back at least twice.",
    "benefit": "You gain a single-use supernatural ability to save yourself from death. The next time you would be killed, you may use this ability, leaving you alive and otherwise unaffected by the attack that would have killed you, even against effects with no saving throw. This does not require an action, and works even if you are helpless or unconscious. If you die and are brought back to life, you gain another single use of this ability. You can only have one use of this ability unspent at any time; any others you might accrue beyond the first are lost."
