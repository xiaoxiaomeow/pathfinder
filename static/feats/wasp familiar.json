    "url": "https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Wasp%20Familiar",
    "source": ["Dirty Tactics Toolbox pg. 17"],
    "text": "The goddess of lust, revenge, and trickery has granted you a living sting to show her favor in you.",
    "prerequisites": "Chaotic neutral alignment, worshiper of Calistria.",
    "benefit": "You gain a familiar as per the arcane bond class feature, using your character level as your wizard level. The familiar is a cat-sized, chaotic neutral wasp loyal to you. Use the statistics for a greensting scorpion familiar (<i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic<\/i> 188), but give it a base speed of 10 feet, a fly speed of 40 feet (average), no Climb bonus, and Fly +7. If you have the ability to gain a familiar through other means (such as the arcane bond class feature), and you are at least 5th level, instead use the statistics for an imp, but replace the <i>invisibility<\/i> spell-like ability with an <i>unnatural lust<\/i> (DC 14) spell-like ability usable three times per day. You can have only one familiar.<br><br> If you ever grossly violate the code of conduct required by Calistria (a violation of the scale that would cause a cleric of Calistria to lose all spells and class features), your familiar turns on you and attacks you until it is killed. To regain a familiar, you must atone for your deeds with the <i>atonement<\/i> spell, and pay to have the slain familiar raised from the dead. If your familiar is slain or lost through other means, you can replace it using the normal rules for replacing familiars.",
    "special": "This feat can be taken a second time by characters of 7th or higher level if they do not otherwise have access to familiars. Such characters have access to a wasp familiar that uses the statistics for an imp, as described above.",
    "name_zh": "巨蜂魔宠",
    "text_zh": "你虔心侍奉色欲之女神讨到了祂的欢心，作为奖励祂借你一根自己的毒刺。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "混乱中立阵营，信仰卡莉斯翠。",
    "benefit_zh": "你获得一个魔宠，如同法师的奥术联结所赋予的魔宠一般，但它是一只家猫大小，混乱中立阵营的大黄蜂。该魔宠使用绿蛰蝎UM魔宠的数据，但拥有10尺移动速度，40尺飞行速度（机动性一般），没有攀爬技能加值但是飞行技能+7。如果你以其他的途径获得了魔宠（比如兼职法师并通过奥术联结选择魔宠）且至少拥有5个角色等级，那么这只大黄蜂的数据上升为小魔鬼，它无法使用隐形术，但取而代之，每天可以施放3次类法术能力欲火焚身（Unnatural Lust，DC14）UM。你同时只能拥有一只魔宠。<\/p><p>如果你违背卡莉斯翠的教义（任何可以导致卡莉斯翠的牧师失去牧师能力的行为），巨蜂魔宠会立刻攻击你直到你们二者之一死亡。如果你杀死了自己的魔宠而又想复活它，那么你必须接受一个法术赎罪术，并且花费正常魔宠复活所需要的代价。如果巨蜂魔宠并不是死于上述情况，那么它可以以正常魔宠复活的方式被复活。",
    "special_zh": "如果你达到7级且没有其他魔宠，你可以再次选择本专长，将巨蜂魔宠的数据以上述方式提升。"
