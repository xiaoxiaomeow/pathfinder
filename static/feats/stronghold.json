    "url": "https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Stronghold",
    "descriptors": ["Story"],
    "source": ["Ultimate Campaign pg. 72"],
    "text": "You seek to build a bastion against which your enemies shall break like water against the rocks.",
    "prerequisites": "You must have the Leadership feat and must lead at least 10 combat-capable followers (such as fighters or rangers).",
    "benefit": "You can spend a move action to give battle orders to your troops, granting creatures under your command within 60 feet your choice of a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, a +1 dodge bonus to AC, or a +1 bonus on a single type of saving throw. All creatures must receive the same benefit. You can’t use this benefit on allies not under your command. This is a language-dependent, mind-affecting effect.",
    "goal": "Build or capture a stronghold capable of housing a force of at least 200 troops, and staff it with at least 100 combat-capable soldiers (or the equivalent) under your command. You must also provide food and water sufficient to survive at least a 6-month siege and a gold reserve sufficient for at least 6 months of wages if your troops require pay.",
    "completionBenefit": "Your battle order bonuses improve to +2, and the range of your orders increases to 120 feet. In addition, you can give two different orders to your troops. For example, you could grant your archers +2 on attack rolls while your front line gains a +2 bonus to AC.",
    "name_zh": "坚实要塞",
    "text_zh": "你试图建造一座迟早要面对敌军侵袭的堡垒，如同礁石等待着海浪的冲击。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "你必须拥有“领导力（Leadership）”专长，并统帅10名以上具有战斗力的追随者（譬如战士或游侠）。",
    "benefit_zh": "你能够通过移动动作向军队下达命令，给予60尺内你所选定的生物以攻击检定+1士气加值、闪避AC+1、或单项豁免+1三者之一。所有生物必须获益于同一效果。你不能通过此方式为你无权指挥的同伴带来收益。这是一个依赖语言的影响心智效果。",
    "goal_zh": "建造或占据一座足以容纳200名军士的要塞，并为其征募100名以上具有战斗力且听命于你的士兵。此外你还必须为要塞储备足以应对围攻战6个月的粮食与饮水供给，以及足以支付军饷、维护军备达6个月的资金。",
    "completionBenefit_zh": "你的战斗指令加值增至+2，并且指令影响范围扩至120尺半径。此外，你可以向军队下达两项不同的指令。举例而言，你可以令弓箭手攻击检定+2，同时令前排步兵AC+2。"
