    "benefit": "This feat acts as Weapon of the Chosen, except you gain the benefits on all attacks until the start of your next turn. Your attacks gain a single alignment component of your deity—either chaotic, evil, good, or lawful—for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. If your deity is neutral with no other alignment components, your attacks instead overcome damage reduction as though your weapon were both cold iron and silver.",

    "staminaText_zh": "当你使用这个专长时，在它的正常持续时间结束时你可以消耗2点耐力来延长持续时间到你的下一回合结束。"
