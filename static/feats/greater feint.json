You gain the benefits of this feat only as long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool. If you have at least 1 point in your stamina pool, you can feint as a swift action, but the feint causes the opponent to become flat-footed only for your next attack rather than for all attacks until the beginning of your next turn.",
