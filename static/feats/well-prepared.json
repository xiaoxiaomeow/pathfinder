    "prerequisites": "Halfling.",
    "benefit": "Once per day, when confronted with a situation that calls for a particular mundane item of equipment, you may make a Sleight of Hand check with a DC of 10 plus the item’s cost in gold pieces to “happen” to have such an item on your person. For example, having a crowbar would be DC 12, whereas a flask of acid would be DC 20. The item must be something you can easily carry—if you are on foot and have only a backpack, for example, you could not have a large iron cauldron. You cannot have magical items using this feat, nor can you have specific items, such as the key to a particular door. If you are stripped of your equipment or possessions, you lose the benefits of this feat until you have at least a day to resupply and “acquire” new items. You must pay for these items normally.",
    "special": "At the GM’s option, a character can substitute the Survival skill for Sleight of Hand with this feat. Such a choice is permanent.",

    "text_zh": "不知为何，你似乎总是有趁手的工具或者粮食储备在手边。",

    "benefit_zh": "每日1次，当你面对的情况需要某种普通的装备物品时，你可以进行一次DC为“10+物品的金币价值”的巧手检定，来“碰巧”从你的个人物品中取得这件道具。比如，拿出撬棍的DC为12，而拿出一瓶强酸的DC为20。这件物品必须是某种易于你携带的道具——比如，如果你徒步行走并且只有一个背包，那么你不能掏出一口大铁锅。你不能使用该专长获得魔法物品，也不能获得某种特殊物品，比如某一扇门的钥匙。如果你脱光装备或者个人物品，那么你会失去该专长的好处，直至你再次拥有这些物品至少1天为止，来使你获得补给，用于“获取”新的道具。你必须如常支付这些物品的价值。",
    "special_zh": "经过GM的允许，角色可以使用生存技能替代巧手技能来使用该专长。这一选择是永久性的。"
