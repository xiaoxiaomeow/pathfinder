    "source": ["Wilderness Origins pg. 15"],
    "text": "You can travel between magic plants and plants with which you have an affinity.",
    "prerequisites": "Con 13, character level 7th, plant type.",
    "benefit": "Once per day, you can step into an adjacent plant with which you share affinity, then exit from a plant of the same kind. This functions as <i>tree stride<\/i> with the following changes: the duration is 1 round; the transport range is 200 feet per character level; transporting yourself is a standard action; and a ghoran using this ability can pass through any living tree, while a vine leshy can pass through any living vine. You can also enter any magically created or enhanced plants, such as those produced by <i>wall of thorns<\/i> or plants affected by <i>entangle<\/i>, then exit from either another similar plant or a plant with which you have an affinity.",
    "special": "The GM determines plant affinity for non-ghoran and nonâ€“vine leshy plant creatures."
