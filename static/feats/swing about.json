    "benefit": "If you have a free hand, as a move action you can grab a willing adjacent ally who also has this feat and place her in any other space adjacent to you. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You can do this only with allies who are able to move freely (not grappled, held, prone, slowed, or otherwise suffering restricted movement) and who are of your size or smaller.",
