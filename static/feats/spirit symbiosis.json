    "text": "Your phantom is impressionable and easily influenced by contact with new spirits.",
    "prerequisites": "Ability to cast <i>speak with dead<\/i>, phantom class feature.",
    "benefit": "When you cast <i>speak with dead<\/i>, you can choose not to gain any of the normal effects of the spell, instead temporarily merging the summoned spirit into your phantom, exchanging your phantom’s current emotional focus and all related abilities for a new emotional focus of your choice. This new emotional focus persists for 10 minutes per class level you have, after which your phantom’s original emotional focus returns."
