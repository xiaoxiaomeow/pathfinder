    "text": "You have quite the impressive collection of tattoos that commemorate your connection to and achievements within the Golden League.",
    "prerequisites": "Regional trait associated with one of the Dragon Empires nations (<i>Pathfinder Player Companion: Dragon Empires Primer<\/i>).",
    "benefit": "You have an impressive collection of tattoos, which are visible unless you wear concealing clothing or succeed at a DC 10 Disguise check. You can take 10 on Intimidate checks against creatures able to see your tattoos, even when stress or distractions would normally prevent you from doing so. You add Knowledge (local) to the skills associated with the presence tactic for verbal duels (<i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Intrigue<\/i>), and the first time you win an exchange with that tactic you do not take a penalty on associated skill checks if you repeat the tactic in the same duel."
