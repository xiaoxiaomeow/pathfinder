    "benefit": "Your penalties on attack rolls for fighting with two weapons are reduced. The penalty for your primary hand lessens by 2 and the one for your off hand lessens by 6. See Two-Weapon Fighting in Combat.",
    "normal": "If you wield a second weapon in your off hand, you can get one extra attack per round with that weapon. When fighting in this way you suffer a –6 penalty with your regular attack or attacks with your primary hand and a –10 penalty to the attack with your off hand. If your off-hand weapon is light, the penalties are reduced by 2 each. An unarmed strike is always considered light.",

    "staminaText": "You can spend any number of stamina points to reduce the penalty from Two-Weapon Fighting on attacks made with a weapon in your primary hand by 1 for every 2 stamina points you spent. This benefit lasts until the start of your next turn. You can’t reduce the penalty below 0.",
