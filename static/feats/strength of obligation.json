    "url": "https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Strength%20of%20Obligation",
    "source": ["Blood of the Ancients pg. 20"],
    "text": "As a follower of Pao-Lung, you draw strength from your duties and obligations. You know that your every action has a great effect on the world around you, and that to falter is to threaten the spokes of the wheel of society.",
    "prerequisites": "Must be devoted to the philosophy of Pao- Lung and not worship any deities.",
    "benefit": "Once per day, you may swear an oath to accomplish a specific goal that has a clearly defined condition for success. While you are undertaking actions to fulfill this promise, you gain a +1 morale bonus on ability checks and skill checks directly related to achieving that goal. This bonus increases to +2 if the task in question is a responsibility that comes with a title or office you hold. If you ever fail to uphold a promise that you make, or are derelict in the duties of an office or title you hold, you lose the benefits from this feat and instead take a â€“1 penalty on ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 24 hours."
