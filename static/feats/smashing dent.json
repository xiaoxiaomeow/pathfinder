    "benefit": "While using Smashing Style, each time you damage a suit of armor with a sunder combat maneuver, you reduce its armor bonus to its Armor Class by 1 and increase its armor check penalty by 1. Armor cannot have its armor bonus to AC reduced to less than 50% of its normal bonus or its armor check penalty more than doubled. These reductions and increases both end when the damage dealt by the sunder is repaired.",
