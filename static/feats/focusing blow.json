    "text": "You and your allies work together to shake off mental effects.",
    "prerequisites": "Hobgoblin Discipline, hobgoblin.",
    "benefit": "An ally who also has this feat can deal damage to you in order to break an ongoing mind-affecting effect that allows a saving throw. The ally must cause at least 5 points of damage to you with an attack, spell, or other ability. You then reroll your saving throw, with a +1 bonus for every 5 additional points of damage the attack caused. If your save is successful, the mind-affecting effect ends. Only damage actually dealt counts for purposes of this feat; nonlethal damage and damage reduced or eliminated by damage reduction, resistances, and so on does not qualify.",

    "text_zh": "你和你盟友的团队协作打破了敌人精神攻击的影响。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "大地精军规，大地精。",
    "benefit_zh": "同样拥有该专长的盟友可以通过对你造成伤害，给予你再一次豁免持续性影响心灵效果的机会。盟友必须以攻击、法术或其他能力对你造成至少5点伤害。你每受到5点伤害，就会在接下来的重新豁免中获得+1加值。如果你豁免成功，则影响心灵的效果立刻结束。该专长的影响只计算实际造成的伤害；非致命伤害以及被减免的伤害等不算在内。"
