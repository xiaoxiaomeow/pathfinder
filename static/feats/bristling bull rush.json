    "text": "You deal damage to opponents when bull rushing them through difficult terrain, using the environment itself to harm your targets.",
    "prerequisites": "Str 13, Improved Bull Rush, Power Attack, base attack bonus +3.",
    "benefit": "When you successfully bull rush a creature, it takes 1d4 points of damage for every 5 feet it is pushed through naturally occurring difficult terrain. This damage is in addition to any damage the creature might normally take from moving through the difficult terrain. Creatures with the woodland stride special ability or who are otherwise unaffected by difficult terrain are immune to this extra damage.",
