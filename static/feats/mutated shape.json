    "benefit": "When you use wild shape, you grow an additional appendage of your choice that can be used to make one of the following attacks: bite, claw, gore, slam, sting, or talons. The appendage can be used as part of a full attack using your highest base attack bonus, and it deals damage as described in Table 3â€“2: Mutated Shape Appendage Attacks. This appendage lasts for as long as you stay in the same form with this use of wild shape.<br><table class=\"inner\"><tr><td>"
