    "prerequisites": "Oread.",
    "benefit": "Whenever you move, you may move through 5 feet of earth- or stone-based difficult terrain (rubble, stone stairs, and so on) each round as if it were normal terrain. The effects of this feat stack with similar feats such as Acrobatic Steps and Nimble Moves. This feat allows you to take a 5-foot step into this kind of difficult terrain.",

    "text_zh": "大地承认你的亲缘关系并且不再妨碍你的行动。",

    "benefit_zh": "每当你移动时，每轮你可以忽略5尺土地以及岩石造成的困难地形（碎石，石阶等等）。该专长的效果同类专长叠加，比如“神行步”或者“灵狐步”专长。该专长允许你在此类困难地形中使用五尺快步。"
