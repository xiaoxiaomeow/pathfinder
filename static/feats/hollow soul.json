    "source": ["Planar Adventures pg. 29"],
    "text": "You can temporarily replace your soul with a fragment of the all-consuming void of Abaddon.",
    "prerequisites": "Knowledge (planes) 9 ranks.",
    "benefit": "As a move action, you can enter a state of emotional and spiritual hollowness. While in this state, you react to positive and negative energy as if you were undead— positive energy harms you, while negative energy heals you. Whenever you are targeted by an effect that specifically affects living creatures or undead creatures, or that affects both in different ways, you have a 50% chance to count as an undead creature rather than a living creature. You are immune to effects that specifically target your soul (such as trap the soul). However, while under the effect of this feat, you cannot benefit from beneficial mind-affecting effects, morale bonuses, or bardic performances.<br><br> You can use this feat’s benefit for a number of minutes per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). These minutes need not be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments.",
    "name_zh": "空无之魂",
    "text_zh": "你暂时用末日荒原里能吞噬一切的空无碎片来代替你的灵魂。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "知能识（位面）9级。",
    "benefit_zh": "以一个移动动作，你可以进入一种情感和精神双重空虚的状态，在这种状态下，正能量和负能量对你的效果如同对不死生物一样，正能量会伤害你，而负能量会治疗你。每当你成为可以影响活物或不死生物特殊效果的效果目标时，或成为以不同方式影响两者的效果目标时，你有50%的几率被视为不死生物而不是活物。你免疫针对你灵魂的效果（比如锢魂术）。不过当你处于本专长的影响时，你不能从影响心灵(mind-affecting)效果、士气加值和吟游诗人表演中受益。你每天能使用本专长的分钟等于你的知识（位面）等级。这些时间不必连续使用，但每次启动至少以1分钟为单位使用本专长。"
