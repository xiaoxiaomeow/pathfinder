You gain a +2 bonus on Bluff checks to feint living herbivorous or omnivorous creatures. In addition, whenever you successfully feint such an opponent, in addition to the normal effects of being feinted in combat, that opponent takes a â€“2 penalty on Perception checks and concentration checks until the start of your next turn."
