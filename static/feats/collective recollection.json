    "benefit": "When an ally who also has this feat attempts a trained Knowledge skill check while within 30 feet of you, you may attempt an aid another check as a free action to improve that ally’s skill check. You must have at least 1 rank in the Knowledge skill to be aided in order to use this feat. If you succeed at the aid another check, you automatically know any information your ally gains from the Knowledge check as if you had rolled the Knowledge check. Whether or not your aid another check is successful, you cannot attempt a Knowledge check to determine the same information as your ally after using this feat.",

    "text_zh": "你和你的盟友可以很快地互相提醒来回忆起基本事实。",
    "benefit_zh": "当一名同样有此专长的盟友在你30尺范围内进行一次已受训的知识检定时，你可以以一次自由动作来协助他进行这次检定。你必须在进行检定的知识上拥有至少1级才能够运用此专长协助他人。如果你的协助成功了，那么你将自动获知该盟友通过知识检定所知道的一切，就如同是你进行了该次检定一样。无论你的协助是否成功，在一名盟友使用过该专长后，你都无法对同一信息进行进行知识检定了。"
