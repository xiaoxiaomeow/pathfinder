    "benefit": "You can spend a day of downtime to purchase one type of capital for half its normal cost (see Purchasing Capital on page 77 of <i>Ultimate Campaign<\/i>). This capital must be the same as the focus capital you chose for the Focused Worker feat. However, the cost of the neglected capital, chosen as part of the same Focused Worker feat, increases by half again its normal amount. These changes in price apply to both the purchased cost and the earned cost of the affected forms of capital.",
