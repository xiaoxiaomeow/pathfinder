    "prerequisites": "Str 13, Improved Drag, Power Attack, base attack bonus +6 or monk level 3rd.",
    "benefit": "When you succeed at a drag combat maneuver check, at the end of your movement, you can fall prone to launch your target over your head. If you do, you move the target of your drag combat maneuver into the space adjacent to you that is opposite its position at the end of your movement, and the target falls prone in that square or squares. You can’t use this ability to move a creature into a square that is occupied by a solid object or obstacle. If there would not be enough room for the creature in its new position, the ability fails and the creature is not moved.",

    "benefit_zh": "当你成功通过拖拽战技检定时，在移动结束后，你可以俯卧下来把敌人扔过你的头顶。如果如此做，你把你拖拽的目标移动到与其原本所在格相对的你的相邻方格，目标会在该方格摔倒俯卧。你不能使用这一能力把一个生物移动到被坚实物体或障碍物占据的方格。如果应移动的方格处没有足够的空间，则该能力使用失败，目标未被移动。"
