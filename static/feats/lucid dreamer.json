    "benefit": "You have greater control of the highly morphic qualities and wild magic of the Dimension of Dreams. You gain a +4 bonus on Charisma checks to determine your initial condition when your lucid body (see page 242) enters a dream and when attempting impossible feats in a dreamscape, and a +2 bonus on caster level checks to prevent a spell or spell-like ability from going awry because of wild magic. If someone casts a <i>dream council<\/i> spell that includes you as a target while you are dreaming, you can enter a shared dreamscape as described in that spell without spending a casting of <i>dream<\/i> or <i>dream council<\/i>. If your lucid body dies while in a dreamscape, you wake up fatigued.",
