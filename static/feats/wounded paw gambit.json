    "prerequisites": "Broken Wing Gambit, Bluff 5 ranks.",
    "benefit": "Whenever you use Broken Wing Gambit and an opponent attacks you as a result, each ally who has this feat and is within 30 feet of that opponent can attempt a ranged attack against it as an immediate action. The ally’s ranged weapon must be in hand, loaded, and ready to be fired or thrown in order to make this attack possible.<br><br> An ally who has this feat and Broken Wing Gambit can instead use Broken Wing Gambit to attempt an attack of opportunity against the foe, but cannot attempt both that attack of opportunity and this ranged attack.",

    "benefit_zh": "当你发动弃兵断翼专长的效果并且敌人对你发动攻击时，你同样拥有此专长且距离目标30尺内的盟友将可以以一个直觉动作对其发动一次远程攻击，前提是他持有一件装填好或者可以投掷的远程武器。同时拥有本专长和弃兵断翼专长的盟友也可以转而使用后者的效果对目标发动借机攻击，但无法既发动借机攻击也进行本专长提供的远程攻击。",
    "staminaText_zh": "当你做出一次该专长赋予的远端攻击时，你可以消耗5点耐力来让那次远端攻击变为一次借机攻击而不是一次直觉动作。你仍只能在一轮中使用该专长做出一次攻击。"
