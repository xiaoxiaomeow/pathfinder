    "text": "You have the ability to perfectly emulate a human.",
    "prerequisites": "Change shape ability, shapechanger subtype, must be able to change shape into a human or must have a true form that appears human.",
    "benefit": "You count as both human and your race for the purpose of taking character options, such as archetypes, feats, spells, traits, and prestige classes. In addition, you count as human for all other effects whenever you would otherwise appear human. For instance, a +1 human bane arrow would deal additional damage to a kitsune with this feat while she was in her human form (as per change shape), but not in her true form. Likewise, such an arrow would deal additional damage to a skinwalker with this feat while she was in her true form, but would not in her bestial form (as per change shape).",
    "name_zh": "人类伪装",
    "text_zh": "你拥有完美模拟一个人类的能力。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "变身（Change shape）能力，变形生物子类（shapechanger subtype），必须能够变身成人类或者真实形态拥有人类外表。",
    "benefit_zh": "在决定人物选项时你同时被视作人类和你的种族，例如变体，专长，法术，背景，进阶职业。另外，当你呈现出人类形态，在判断所有相关效果时你被认为是一个人类。例如：一支+1破敌（人类）的箭矢会对使用这个专长进入人类形态（如同变身）的狐妖造成额外伤害，但是在她的真实形态下则不会。同样的，一支+1破敌（人类）的箭矢会对拥有这个专长并在真实形态下的skinwalker（Bestiary 5）造成额外伤害，但是在她野兽形态下则不会。"
