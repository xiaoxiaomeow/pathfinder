    "source": ["Ultimate Combat pg. 105"],
    "text": "When you impale a target, you hinder its movement and can cause severe bleeding.",
    "prerequisites": "Impaling Critical, Critical Focus, Weapon Specialization with selected piercing melee weapon, base attack bonus +13.",
    "benefit": "While you are using Impaling Critical to impale an opponent, and you are still holding onto that weapon, that opponent must succeed at a grapple combat maneuver check against you to pull your weapon out. If you have let go of your weapon, the impaled opponent must spend a standard action to remove the weapon. Until the opponent pulls the weapon out, his speed in all modes is halved and his maneuverability, if any, is reduced by one step. When the weapon comes out, instead of dealing the damage normal for Impaling Critical, you can deal bleed damage equal to your weapon’s damage dice result once per round at the start of that opponent’s turn.",

    "staminaText": "When using this feat to impale a foe, you can spend 5 stamina points to immobilize the foe in its current space (instead of halving its movement) for as long as you maintain your grip and the foe is impaled. If you let go of the weapon, the foe can move, but its movement is still halved.",

    "text_zh": "当你穿刺一个目标，你还能阻碍其移动，并导致严重的大出血。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "穿刺重击，重击专攻，武器专精（选定的穿刺武器），BAB+13。",
    "benefit_zh": "每当你使用“穿刺重击”来穿刺一个目标，并且仍持有武器，对手必须与你进行一次擒抱检定对抗才能拔出你的武器。如果你放开了你的武器，对手必须花费标准动作才能抽出武器。在对手抽出武器之前，他的所有移动速度减半，并且飞行机动性（如果有）下降一个等级。当武器被抽离，将不会造成另一次穿刺伤害，而是会导致每一轮对手开始行动时受到相当于你武器伤害骰的出血伤害。",
    "staminaText_zh": "当你使用这个专长来对一个敌人进行穿刺时，你可以消耗5点耐力来把你的敌人限制在当前的空间（而不是将它的移动速度减半），只要你还持有你的武器并且你的敌人仍然处于被刺的状态下。如果你放开了武器，你的敌人可以移动，但是它的移动力仍会减半。"
