    "url": "https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Light%20Gravity%20Acclimation",
    "source": ["Planar Adventures pg. 30"],
    "text": "A realm’s light gravity lets you reach your full potential.",
    "prerequisites": "Dex 13, Acrobatics 3 ranks.",
    "benefit": "Your land speed increases by 10 feet while on a plane with light gravity, and other creatures do not gain a circumstance bonus on attack rolls against you from light gravity. At the GM’s discretion, these effects might apply to certain environments on the Material Plane, such as low-gravity planets. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on Acrobatics checks; if you have 10 or more ranks in Acrobatics, this bonus increases to +4. This bonus does not stack with that provided by the Acrobatic feat."
