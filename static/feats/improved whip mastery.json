    "text": "You are able to entangle opponents with the coils of your whip.",
    "prerequisites": "Weapon Focus (whip), Whip Mastery, base attack bonus +5.",
    "benefit": "While wielding a whip, you threaten the area of your natural reach plus 5 feet. You can also use a whip to grasp an unattended Small or Tiny object within your whip’s reach and pull that object into your square. To do so, you must hit AC 10 with a melee touch attack. Further, you can use the whip to grasp onto an object within your whip’s reach, using 5 feet of your whip as if it were a grappling hook, allowing you to use the rest of your whip to swing on like a rope. As a free action, you can release the object your whip is grasping, but you cannot use the whip to attack while the whip is grasping an object.",

    "staminaText": "At the start of your turn, you can spend 5 stamina points to increase the radius of the area you threaten while wielding a whip by an additional 5 feet until you make an attack against an opponent in the expanded reach or the beginning of your next turn, whichever comes first.",

    "benefit_zh": "当持用长鞭时，你的威胁范围为天生触及外加5尺。你能用长鞭抓起触及范围内的一件小型或超小型无主物品，将其拖到你所在的方格。如此施为你需要进行AC为10的近战接触攻击。此外，你能用长鞭钩住它触及范围内的一件物体，将它5尺长的一段当作抓钩来使用，令你能够把长鞭的剩余部分当作绳索般摇荡。你能以自由动作放开钩住的物体，但你不能在长鞭正钩在物体上的时候用它攻击。",
    "staminaText_zh": "在你回合开始时，你可以消耗5点耐力来提升你持用长鞭的威胁范围的半径额外5尺，直到你在额外触及中对一个敌人使用了借机攻击或者到你下一回合开始，取决于哪一个先发生。"
