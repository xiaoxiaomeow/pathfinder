    "prerequisites": "Improved Dirge of Doom, ability to perform dirge of doom.",
    "benefit": "The effect of your dirge of doom lingers with a target for 2 rounds after the creature leaves the dirge’s area of effect. If you use your dirge on a creature that is shaken, it becomes frightened. If you use it on a creature that is frightened, it becomes panicked. Once affected by this feat, a creature cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.",
    "normal": "Fear effects on a creature end immediately once it leaves the area of dirge of doom. A fear effect cannot be made more extreme by dirge of doom and can be changed only to the frightened condition by the Improved Dirge of Doom feat.",

    "normal_zh": "受到你末日丧歌影响的生物将会在离开你的表演影响范围内立刻不受影响，并且末日丧歌无法提升生物的恐惧状态等级；精通末日丧歌只能将生物的恐惧等级提升到恐慌。"
