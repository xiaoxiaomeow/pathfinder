    "text": "You can set a spell to trigger on a delay.",
    "benefit": "A delayed spell can be activated as a standard action anytime within 1 minute per spell level of being cast. Only spells that target one or more squares or grid intersections can be affected by Delayed Spell, and the target (as well as any other variables determined at the time of casting) cannot be changed once the delayed spell is cast. You can have as many delayed spells as you wish at any given time, but only one spell can be triggered in a single standard action. Though a delayed spell does not manifest until it is triggered, it emits a magical aura as normal and can be identified with Knowledge (arcana) as a spell effect in place. A delayed spell uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spellâ€™s actual level."
