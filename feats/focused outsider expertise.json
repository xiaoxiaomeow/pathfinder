    "prerequisites": "Favored enemy (outsider) class feature.",
    "benefit": "Your weapon attacks ignore a number of points of damage reduction equal to half your favored enemy (outsider [any one]) bonus. This feat allows you to ignore only damage reduction that is normally bypassed by chaotic-, evil-, good-, or lawful-aligned weapons. Against outsiders that match your favored enemy subtype, the amount of damage reduction and hardness you ignore is equal to your full favored class bonus.",
