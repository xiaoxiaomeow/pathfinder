    "text": "When you cast a spell using esoteric materials, you reinforce your spell’s magical structure, making the spell difficult to stop or remove.",
    "benefit": "When you use esoteric material components as part of casting a spell, you gain a +2 bonus on concentration checks to cast that spell, and the spell is treated as though its caster level were 2 higher against attempts to dispel it. This increase is in addition to any increases due to greater component or limited magic benefits.",

    "text_zh": "当你使用奇特施法材料来施展法术时，你会强化你的法术的魔法建模，使其难以停止或移除。",
    "benefit_zh": "当你使用一个使用奇特施法材料的法术时，你可以在施展这个法术的专注上获得+2加值，并且你在对抗尝试解除法术效果时施法者等级视为高2级。这个加值独立于由于高等材料效果或是有限施法效果而带来的加值。"
