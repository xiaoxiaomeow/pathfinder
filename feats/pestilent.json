    "text": "Your unarmed strikes and natural weapons cause extra harm to those infected with your disease.",
    "prerequisites": "Ability to cause disease via a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural means.",
    "benefit": "When you successfully use a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability to cause a creature to contract a disease, you gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls with natural weapons and unarmed strikes against that creature. In addition, such attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of negative energy damage. If you have the supernatural ability to cause a single disease (such as mummy rot), you gain these bonuses against any creature that has contracted the same disease, even if it did not contract it from you."
