    "url": "https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Overwhelming%20Phantom",
    "source": ["Occult Origins pg. 19"],
    "text": "Your phantom is strong-willed, allowing it to enter and dominate other creature’s minds.",
    "prerequisites": "Phantom class feature, spiritualist level 15th.",
    "benefit": "Three times per day, as a standard action while it is fully manifested, your phantom can attempt to enter and take control of a living creature; doing so provokes an attack of opportunity. A creature can resist this influence with a successful Will save (DC = 1/2 the phantom’s Hit Dice + the phantom’s Charisma modifier). A phantom can maintain this control for 1 minute per spiritualist level you have, but the victim is allowed a new saving throw each minute. This ability otherwise functions as <i>greater possession<\/i>."
