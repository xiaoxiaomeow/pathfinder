    "benefit": "When you take this feat, choose one domain granted by your deity. You can use the 1st-level domain ability that clerics of that domain can use a number of times or rounds per day, but you can use it only once per day or 1 round per day, whichever is appropriate. Your effective cleric level in regard to this ability is 1st level. If the domain has a 1st-level ability that does not meet this specification, you cannot use it.",
    "special": "You can take this feat twice. When you take it a second time, you choose another domain granted by your deity.<br><br> If you grossly violate the code of conduct required by your deity, your alignment shifts so that it is more than one step away from your deity’s, or you no longer worship your deity, you lose access to this feat. You can regain it once you atone for your misdeeds to your deity (see the <i>atonement <\/i>spell on page 245 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook<\/i>).",

    "prerequisites_zh": "感知13，阵营必须与你信仰的神祇阵营相差不超过一阶。",
    "benefit_zh": "选择一个你信仰神祇的牧师领域，你可以使用具有每日次数或轮数限制的1级神授力量，但你只能每日使用1次或者1轮（看哪种更适合）。你只能获得该领域能力，而且不能获得更高级的领域能力、领域奖励法术或领域神授能力带来的本职技能与奖励专长。在使用此能力时你的有效牧师等级视为1级。如果该领域1级神授力量没有次数或轮数限制，你就无法使用。",
    "special_zh": "你可以选择本专长最多两次。当你再次选择本专长时，你获得另一个神祇领域的领域能力。如果你蓄意违反你神祇的信条，或是你的阵营偏移到超过距离你神祇阵营一阶以上，或是你不再信仰该神祇，你将失去本专长。直到你赎罪为止（见法术赎罪术说明）。"
