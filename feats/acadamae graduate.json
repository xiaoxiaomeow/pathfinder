    "source": ["Curse of the Crimson Throne Player's Guide pg. 11"],
    "text": "You have passed the grueling Test of Summoning and graduated from the Acadamae.",
    "prerequisites": "Specialist wizard 1st; cannot have conjuration as a forbidden school.",
    "benefit": "Whenever you cast a prepared arcane spell from the conjuration (summoning) school that takes longer than a standard action to cast, reduce the casting time by one round (to a minimum casting time of one standard action). Casting a spell in this way is taxing and requires a Fortitude save (DC 15 + spell level) to resist becoming fatigued."
