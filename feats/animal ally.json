    "prerequisites": "Nature Soul, character level 4th, must not have an animal companion or mount that advances as an animal companion.",
    "benefit": "You gain an animal companion as if you were a druid of your character level –3 from the following list: badger, bird, camel, cat (small), dire rat, dog, horse, pony, snake (viper), or wolf.
