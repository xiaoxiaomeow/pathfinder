    "text": "You can take advantage of a distracted foe.",
    "benefit": "When you attempt a combat maneuver check against a foe you are flanking, you can forgo the +2 bonus on your attack roll for flanking to instead have the combat maneuver not provoke an attack of opportunity. If you have a feat or ability that allows you to attempt the combat maneuver without provoking an attack of opportunity, you can instead increase the bonus on your attack roll for flanking to +4 for the combat maneuver check.",
    "special": "This feat counts as having Dex 13, Int 13, Combat Expertise, and Improved Unarmed Strike for the purposes of meeting the prerequisites of the various improved combat maneuver feats, as well as feats that require those improved combat maneuver feats as prerequisites.",
    "name_zh": "何须荣誉",
    "text_zh": "你专注于在敌人无暇多顾时狠狠打他。",
    "benefit_zh": "每当你对一个被你夹击的敌人使用战技攻击时，你可以选择放弃夹击通过的+2加值而是使你的战技攻击不会引发借机攻击。 如果你拥有了使战技不会引发借机攻击的能力或专长，那么你在上述情况发动战技攻击时，在攻击检定上获得+4加值。",
    "special_zh": "本专长可以在你选择任何精通战技类专长时视为拥有13敏捷，13智力，寓守于攻和精通徒手击打作为先决条件，也可以取代需要特定的精通战技专长作为先决条件的专长的先决条件。"
