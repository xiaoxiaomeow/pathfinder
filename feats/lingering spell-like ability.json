    "prerequisites": "Spell-like ability at caster level 4th or higher.",
    "benefit": "Choose one of your spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a lingering spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).<br><br> A lingering spell-like ability causes an instantaneous spelllike ability that affects an area to persist until the beginning of its next turn. Targets already in the area suffer no additional harm, but other creatures or objects entering the area are subject to its effects. A lingering spell-like ability with a visual manifestation obscures vision, providing concealment (20% miss chance) beyond 5 feet and total concealment (50% miss chance) beyond 20 feet.<br><br> You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) – 1. For a summary, see Table 3–1.",
    "special": "This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.<br><br><table class=\"inner\"><tr><td>"
