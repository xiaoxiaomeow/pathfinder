    "text": "The strict military culture of Molthune inspires uncommon valor in you.",
    "prerequisites": "Molthune affinity.",
    "benefit": "Any effect that would normally make you panicked instead makes you frightened. Any effect that would make you frightened instead makes you shaken. Any effect that would make you shaken only lasts half as long (minimum 1 round). Note that you can still become increasingly frightened by multiple fear effects from different sources, but that each source is modified before it is applied to you. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on any saving throw versus fear effects.",
    "special": "You may only gain this feat at 1st level."
