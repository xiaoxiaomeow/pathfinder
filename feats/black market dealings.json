    "benefit": "You gain a +4 bonus on Diplomacy checks to access black markets and do not pay the gp cost to do so. You suffer no consequences for failing the check unless you fail by 10 or more.<br><br> In addition, you can use the Diplomacy skill to locate merchants who have deeper pockets in a black market or settlement. If you are looking inside a black market, the DC is equal to the black market’s access DC. If you are looking more widely in a settlement, use the black market’s access DC + 5 (if a settlement has no black market, the DC is 30; PCs can apply the settlement’s Crime modifier to their checks). If successful, you can treat the black market or settlement as one step larger for the purposes of base value, items available, and purchase limit. If the settlement was already a metropolis, nearly all minor and medium magic items are for sale, as well as 3d8 major magic items; the base value is 32,000 gp; and the purchase limit is 200,000 gp. If the black market was already an underworld, nearly all minor and medium magic items are for sale, as well as 4d8 major magic items; the base value is 64,000 gp; and the purchase limit is 300,000 gp. This benefit does not stack with other ways to increase the effective size of a black market or settlement (such as the black market connections rogue talent). You can attempt this check only once per week.",

    "benefit_zh": "你在进入黑市的准入检定的交涉中获得+4加值，且你无需为此付费。如果你没有失败10或以上，则你不会受到准入检定的失败惩罚。<\/p><p>除此之外，你可以用交涉技能寻找定居点或黑市内的富商。如果你希望在黑市内寻找，那么DC等于黑市的准入检定DC；如果你希望在定居点内寻找，那么DC等于黑市的准入检定DC+5（如果没有黑市，那么DC=30，玩家可以将定居点的犯罪调整值作为额外加值）。如果检定成功，你可以把当前的黑市或定居点视为成大一级的存在，决定基础购买价值，可购物品数量和购买限额。如果当前定居点已经是都会，则所有的次级和中级魔法物品均可购买，高级物品提高到3D8个，基础购买价值提高到32000GP，购买限额提高到200，000gp。如果当前黑市已经是地下王国，则所有的次级和中级魔法物品均可购买，高级物品提高到4D8个，基础购买价值提高到64000gp，购买限额提高到300，000gp。该专长不与其他能够提高黑市或定居点类型的专长叠加（例如黑市客户（Black Market Connections）UC盗贼天赋）。你每周只能进行一次检定。"
