    "text": "You invoke an ancestral boon to modify your fatal blows, and those of your allies, so that they render your foes merely unconscious.",
    "prerequisites": "Wis 13.",
    "benefit": "As a swift action once per day, you may call upon the spirits of your ancestors to prevent your opponents from dying. For the remainder of the combat, all of your dying opponents are stabilized at their current hit points, and any opponents who would be killed by damage from you or your allies are instead reduced to â€“1 hit point and stabilized. This is a supernatural ability. If an ally wants to kill an opponent despite the efforts of your ancestral spirits, she may attempt a Will saving throw (DC equal to 10 plus half your level plus your Wisdom modifier); success means her attacks affect the opponents normally."
