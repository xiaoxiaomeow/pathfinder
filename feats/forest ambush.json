    "text": "Your deep knowledge of natural environments allows you to take your enemy by surprise, dealing a deadly blow.",
    "prerequisites": "Stealth 1 rank, Survival 1 rank.",
    "benefit": "In natural environments, you can spend 5 minutes to cover yourself in loose debris (such as branches, grass, or dirt) and take 20 on a Stealth check. You fall prone and are considered to have concealment for purposes of being allowed to attempt Stealth checks. As a full-round action that doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity, you can burst from your hiding place, stand, and make a single melee attack or ranged attack against a target within 30 feet. If the target didn’t notice you before you jumped from hiding and your attack hits, that attack deals an additional 1d6 points of precision damage. Effects that negate sneak attack damage also negate this damage."
