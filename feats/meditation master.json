    "text": "When fully focused on your inner self, you can enter a deep meditative state that allows you a more perfect control over your mind and body.",
    "benefit": "When you meditate for at least 1 hour after getting at least 8 hours of rest, you gain special insight into your situation that is nearly impartial, granting you the edge in whatever endeavor matters most during the day. After meditating, you gain a +1 insight bonus that you can apply to any d20 roll over the course of the next 24 hours without using an action. The bonus may be applied after the roll is made, but must be applied before the results of the roll are determined. Once the bonus has been used for the day, you cannot use it again until after you meditate again after another 8 hours of rest. An unused bonus fades after 24 hours.",
    "name_zh": "冥想大师",
    "text_zh": "当你完全集中于内在自我，你可以进入一种深度冥想状态来获得对精神与肉体的完美掌握。",
    "benefit_zh": "当你在休息至少8小时并进行一次至少1小时的冥想后，你会对你的状态有一种近乎全面的特殊理解。在冥想后，你在接下来24小时内的任何一次D20检定中无需动作获得+1洞察加值。这个加值可以应用在检定进行后，但是必须在结果决定前。一旦当天的加值被使用，你不能再次使用，直到你再次休息8小时并进行冥想。"
