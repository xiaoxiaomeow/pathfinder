    "prerequisites": "Ability to create 2nd-level extracts, alchemy class feature, inspiration† class feature.",
    "benefit": "You can recreate an extract that you consumed during the past hour. You must spend 10 minutes and expend a number of uses of inspiration equal to the level of the extract’s formula to do so. When you recreate an extract in this way, it does not count toward the number of extracts you can prepare in a day.",

    "prerequisites_zh": "可以制造2环化合炼成，炼金术职业能力，灵感职业能力。",
    "benefit_zh": "你可以重新炼制一份在过去的一小时内使用过的化合炼成，这将花费你10分钟时间重新配合材料，并花费相当于这个化合炼成环数的灵感点数。当你以此专长重新调制一份化合炼成，这个化合炼成将不计入你每日可以准备的化合炼成数量。"
