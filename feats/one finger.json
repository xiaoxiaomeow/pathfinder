    "benefit": "You can make Stunning Fist attacks as melee touch attacks. You may not use Power Attack in combination with this feat. You may choose to expend one use of Stunning Fist when making a bull rush, disarm, grapple, sunder, or trip attempt to provide a bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier (if positive) to any attack roll or opposed check required. This bonus applies only to a single attempt and does not apply to subsequent checks (as when continuing a grapple in subsequent rounds). You may use this ability once per round on your turn. You may not use it to defend against combat actions attempted against you.",
