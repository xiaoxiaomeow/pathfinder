    "text": "You can fool scrying attempts by using your familiar.",
    "prerequisites": "Must have a familiar with the decoy archetype (see page 10).",
    "benefit": "As long as your familiar is within 30 feet of you, anytime you succeed at a Will save to negate a scrying effect (including <i>scrying<\/i> and <i>greater scrying<\/i>), you become aware of the scrying attempt as though you succeeded at the Spellcraft check to identify it, and you can choose to let the spell function as normal instead of causing it to fail. If you do, you can choose to redirect the scrying effect toward your familiar, causing the familiar to immediately change shape (as its secret sharer spell-like ability, except the duration is as long as the scrying effect lasts). The creator of the scrying effect observes the familiar as though it were you, though spells such as <i>detect magic<\/i> detect the <i>alter self<\/i> effect as normal.",

    "text_zh": "你可以通过自己的魔宠来愚弄那些想要窥探你的家伙。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "必须具有使用了饵宠（Decoy）变体的魔宠。",
    "benefit_zh": "只要你的魔宠与你之间的距离不超过30尺，每当你成功通过意志豁免以抵御一次探知（scrying）效果时（这包括探知和高等探知），你便会意识到这次探知的尝试，就如同你成功使用了法术辨识检定鉴别了它一般，而且你能够选择让法术如常生效，以取代让其失败。若你这么做，那么你能够选择将探知效果变更至你的魔宠身上，这会使得魔宠立即变形，就如同它的假扮主人（Master's Guise）类法术能力*一般，不过此时的持续时间与探知效果的持续时间相同。探知效果的制造者会一直观察魔宠，就如同目标是你一般，不过侦测魔法（detect magic）之类的法术仍旧会如常侦测到变身术（Alter Self）的效果。<\/p><p>【译注：原文为secret sharer spell-like ability，不过Decoy并没有这个能力，因此按照能力意思选择了Master's Guise能力。】"
