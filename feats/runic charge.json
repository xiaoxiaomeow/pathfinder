    "descriptors": ["Combat"],
    "source": ["People of the Wastes pg. 5"],
    "text": "You can deliver touch spells with frightful ferocity.",
    "prerequisites": "Caster level 5th.",
    "benefit": "As long as two of your hands are free, you can cast a spell with a range of touch and deliver the spell to a single target as part of a charge action. When you do so, you gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome the target’s spell resistance, and the critical threat range of that touch attack is 19–20. This increased threat range does not stack with similar abilities such as Improved Critical."
