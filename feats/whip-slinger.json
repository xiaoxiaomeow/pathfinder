    "text": "You can use your sling as a sap to make attacks of opportunity.",
    "prerequisites": "Proficient with sling.",
    "benefit": "When wielding a sling, double sling, or halfling sling staff, you threaten areas around you as normal and can make attacks of opportunity with the sling into these threatened areas. The sling deals 1d4 nonlethal bludgeoning damage (1d6 for a Medium wielder), threatens a critical hit on a 20, and deals ×2 damage on a critical hit. If the sling isn’t loaded with ammunition when you make an attack of opportunity, you take a –4 penalty on the attack roll.",
    "normal": "Slings and double slings are ranged weapons, do not threaten areas, and cannot make attacks of opportunity. A halfling sling staff can be used as a simple melee weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a club its size; as a melee weapon, it threatens areas normally and its wielder can make attacks of opportunity with it.",

    "text_zh": "你可以挥舞你的投石索发动借机攻击。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "擅长投石索。",
    "benefit_zh": "当装备投石索、双头投石索或半身人杖式投石索时，你可以如常威胁你周围的区域。投石索造成1d4非致命钝击伤害（中体型使用者是1d6），重击乘数2，重击范围20。若投石索没有装填弹药，则在攻击时攻击骰-4。",
    "normal_zh": "投石索和双头投石索是远程武器，没有威胁范围，不能做借机攻击。半身人杖式投石索可以被当做近战简易武器使用，造成等于同体型木棍的钝击伤害；作为近战武器，其持有者有正常的威胁范围，并可以用其做出借机攻击。"
