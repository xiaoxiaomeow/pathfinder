    "text": "You have mastered the art of stealthily and quickly preparing a poisoned weapon.",
    "prerequisites": "Sleight of Hand 5 ranks.",
    "benefit": "Whenever you draw a weapon, you can apply poison to the weapon as part of the same action. To do so, you must already have the poison in hand and must succeed at a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check. Success means the dose of poison is expended and you poison the weapon without drawing attention to your act. This check is in addition to any other Sleight of Hand checks you attempt to perform the action (such as to draw a hidden weapon). Failure means any creatures present can immediately attempt opposed Perception checks to notice your poisoning attempt. If you fail the check by 5 or more, you also expose yourself to the poison unless you have an ability that would prevent accidental poisoning, such as an alchemist’s poison use ability.",

    "prerequisites_zh": "巧手5级。",
    "benefit_zh": "当你拔出一把武器时，你可以以同一个动作的一部分来为武器涂毒。要做到这一点，你必须已经将毒药拿在手上，并且成功通过DC20的巧手检定。成功则意味着该剂毒药已经被使用并且你在不被注意的情况下为武器涂毒。此检定在你尝试其他需要巧手检定动作时（例如拔出隐藏武器）额外进行检定。如果失败，则意味着在场的任何生物都可以对你尝试涂毒的行为进行一次察觉检定。如果你在该检定中失败5点或者更多，你会将自己暴露于毒素中，除非你拥有防止意外中毒的能力，例如炼金术师的用毒（poison use）能力。"
