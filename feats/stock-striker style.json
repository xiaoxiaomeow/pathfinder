    "benefit": "When you perform the pistol-whip deed while using this style, you gain a +1 bonus on the attack roll and on the combat maneuver check to knock the target prone; this increases to +2 when you use a two-handed firearm. If you successfully knock the target prone, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity from the target until the end of your next turn when you make ranged attacks with your firearm. You can treat one-handed firearms as light weapons for the purpose of abilities such as Weapon Finesse when performing the pistol-whip deed.",

    "benefit_zh": "当你使用该流派时，你在施展枪柄打击炫技的攻击骰以及击倒目标至俯卧的战技检定上获得+1加值；该加值在你使用双手火器时增加至+2。若你成功将目标击倒至俯卧，在你下一轮结束前，你在用火器进行远程攻击时不会引发该目标的借机攻击。当你施展枪柄打击炫技时，在满足诸如武器娴熟等类似能力前提时可以将单手火器视作轻型武器。"
