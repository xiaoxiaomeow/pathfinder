    "prerequisites": "Any teamwork feat, ability to control or create undead.",
    "benefit": "When you create undead, they gain one teamwork feat you know as a bonus feat, though they gain its benefits only when cooperating with you or with other undead that you have created. If you control undead with the Command Undead feat or a spell like <i>command undead<\/i>, they likewise gain one teamwork feat you know as a bonus feat as long as they remain under your control. Intelligent undead gain no benefit from this feat."
