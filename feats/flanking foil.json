    "text": "Fighting multiple foes is easy for you.",
    "benefit": "Whenever you hit an adjacent opponent with a melee attack, until the start of your next turn, that opponent does not gain any flanking bonus on attack rolls while it is flanking you and cannot deal sneak attack damage to you. It can still provide a flank for its allies.",
    "staminaSource": "Pathfinder Unchained pg. 119",
    "staminaText": "When using this feat, you can spend 5 stamina points. If you do, your target cannot flank with its allies against you until the start of your next turn.",
    "name_zh": "挫败夹击",
    "text_zh": "你能轻易的打破多个敌人合击你的意图。",
    "benefit_zh": "每当你用近战攻击命中一个敌人，直到你下一次行动开始，即使该敌人夹击你，他也不会获得任何夹击加值，亦不能利用夹击对你进行偷袭。他仍然可以对他的其他盟友提供夹击机会。",
    "staminaText_zh": "当你使用这个专长时，你可以消耗5点耐力。如果你这样做了，目标和他的盟友在你的下一回合开始之前不会构成夹击。"
