    "text": "You are a luminous beacon in the darkness, an icon of order and kindness through which the light of Heaven itself can shine, even in the most dreadful of realms.",
    "prerequisites": "Knowledge (planes) 1 rank.",
    "benefit": "As a standard action, you can emit an aura of bright light centered on a glowing halo above or behind your head. The illumination provided is equal in intensity to that of a torch. If you have at least 5 ranks in Knowledge (planes) the illumination is equivalent to that created by a <i>daylight<\/i> spell. If you have at least 15 ranks in Knowledge (planes), the light becomes further infused with Heavenly power, and each evil creature within 30 feet of you must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your level + your Charisma modifier) or become sickened by the light for as long as it remains in range plus 1 additional round after leaving the area.<br><br> You can use this feat’s benefit for a number of rounds per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). These rounds need not be consecutive.",

    "text_zh": "你是黑暗中闪烁的灯塔，是秩序和善良的象征，即使身处险境，天堂之光亦可闪耀。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "知识（位面）1级。",
    "benefit_zh": "以一个标准动作，你可以发出强光并将其汇聚在你头顶或身后形成一个光环。光环所提供的照明程度相当于火把的照明程度。如果你在知识（位面）上有5或更多个等级，那么光环的照明程度相当于昼明术(daylight)所产生的照明程度。如果你在知识（位面）上有15或更多个等级，那么光环将进一步注入天堂的力量，在你30尺范围内的每个邪恶生物都必须通过DC＝10+你等级的一半+你的魅力调整值的强韧豁免，否则会因光照陷入恶心状态，该效果一直持续到其离开专长作用范围后的一轮时间。你每天可以从这个专长获益的轮数等于你知识（位面）的等级。这些轮数不需连续使用。"
