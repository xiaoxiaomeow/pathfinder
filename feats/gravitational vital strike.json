    "prerequisites": "Vital Strike; Heavy Gravity Acclimation or Light Gravity Acclimation.",
    "benefit": "When using any Vital Strike feat in an area of light or heavy gravity, roll the weapon’s damage dice for the attack one additional time. For example, if using Improved Vital Strike, you would roll the weapon’s damage dice for the attack four times before adding other damage bonuses, instead of three times. You must have the appropriate prerequisite feat associated with the plane’s gravity trait to gain this benefit.",
