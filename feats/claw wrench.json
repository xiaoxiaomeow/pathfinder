    "benefit": "As a standard action, you can attempt a grapple combat maneuver with a –5 penalty against a creature that is currently grappling another creature via its grab special ability. If you succeed, you pry open the creature’s grasp, releasing any creatures it had grappled.<br><br> Additionally, you can ready an action to trigger if a creature attempts a bite attack against you. When the readied action triggers, you can attempt a grapple combat maneuver with a +2 bonus. If you succeed, you grapple the creature and cause the bite attack to miss. As long as you maintain the grapple, the creature can’t use its bite attack.",
