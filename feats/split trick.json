    "benefit": "Whenever you implant a mesmerist trick in a target, you can designate that trick as a split trick. When doing so, you touch two targets and split the trick between them. This counts as implanting a mesmerist trick in both targets. The mesmerist trick functions as normal, except that when the trick’s triggering condition occurs, you must choose one of the split trick’s targets to receive the effects of the split trick. The other target receives no benefit from the trick.",

    "benefit_zh": "当你对一个目标植入催眠师诡计时，你可以指定该诡计为分裂诡计。当你这么做时，你接触两个目标，并将诡计分裂到他们之间。这视为在两个目标中植入催眠师诡计。该催眠师诡计如常运作，除了当诡计的触发条件满足时，你必须选择一个分裂诡计的目标接受分裂诡计的效果。另外一个目标不会再分裂诡计中获得好处。"
