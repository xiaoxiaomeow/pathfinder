    "benefit": "You do not take penalties on your attack rolls or to your AC for squeezing through a narrow space that is at least half as wide as your normal space, though each move into or through a narrow space still counts as if it were 2 squares.",
    "normal": "You take a –4 penalty on attack rolls and a –4 penalty to AC while squeezing.",

    "text_zh": "你那出色的协调性使你更适于在狭窄的空间行动。",

    "benefit_zh": "当你挤入的狭小空间的宽度至少有你通常占据空间的一半时，你的攻击检定与AC不会由于挤压（squeezing）而遭受减值。不过进入或通过狭窄空间时，每次移动仍需消耗双倍的移动距离。",
