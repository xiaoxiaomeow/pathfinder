    "url": "https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Motivated%20March",
    "source": ["Monster Codex pg. 117"],
    "text": "Years of forcing your slaves and soldiers to march far beyond the limits of their endurance have made you an excellent taskmaster.",
    "benefit": "When traveling overland, you and a number of allies equal to 10 times your character level reduce the amount of nonlethal damage taken as a result of a forced march by half. Creatures benefiting from this feat can delay the fatigued effect of a forced march for a number of hours equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). A creature that delays this effect becomes exhausted instead of fatigued when the condition takes effect.",
    "name_zh": "监军",
    "text_zh": "靠着一顿皮鞭或呵斥，作为经验丰富的军官，你可以驱赶自己的奴隶或部下拼老命进行强行军。",
    "benefit_zh": "当进行大陆移动（Overland Movement）时，你可以是让多等同于你的角色等级x10数量的盟友在因为强行军而承受非致命伤害时只承受一半伤害。除此之外，这些生物在强行军是可以延迟进入疲乏状态的时间，最多相当于你的魅力调整值个小时（至少1小时）。但是，这些生物在延迟疲乏以后，他们在强行军结束时会陷入力竭而非疲乏。"
