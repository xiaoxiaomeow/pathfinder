    "prerequisites": "Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8.",
    "benefit": "Befuddling Strike forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll—thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt. A defender who fails this saving throw is confused for 1d4 rounds. You can attempt to use Befuddling Strike once per day for every 4 character levels you have, but can use it no more than once per round. Constructs, incorporeal creatures, mindless creatures, plants, undead, and creatures that are immune to critical hits cannot be affected by this ability.",

    "prerequisites_zh": "敏捷13，感知13，精通徒手击打，BAB+8。",
    "benefit_zh": "你必须在投掷攻击骰之前宣告使用此专长（因此，未命中会导致尝试失败）。混乱拳在正常造成伤害的同时，还会强制受到你徒手击打伤害的敌人进行一次DC=10+1/2你的角色等级+感知调整值的强韧豁免检定。豁免检定失败的防御者将困惑1d4轮。每4级你每天可以多尝试一次混乱攻击（见特殊），每轮不能超过1次。构装、泥怪、植物、不死、虚体生物，无心智和免疫重击的生物不会受到本能力的影响。",
    "staminaText_zh": "如果花费5点耐力，你可以在攻击命中后再选择是否使用混乱拳。"
