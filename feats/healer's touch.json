    "descriptors": ["Achievement"],
    "source": ["Legacy of Fire Player's Guide pg. 29"],
    "text": "The magic of life flows through your body like a river.",
    "prerequisites": "Cure a cumulative total of 1, 000 points of damage for other creatures using healing spells. Dealing damage slows progress toward this goal achievement; for every 1 point of damage you deal to another creature, reduce your cumulative healing total by 2.",
    "benefit": "When you cast a healing spell to heal a target other than yourself, the spell is maximized as though using the Maximize Spell effect. This does not increase your casting time for the spell. When you cast a healing spell to damage a target, the spell is not maximized but its saving throw DC increases by +4."
