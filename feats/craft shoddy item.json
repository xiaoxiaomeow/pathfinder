    "text": "You can create poorly constructed items that appear to be just as sturdy and as of good quality as normal goods, saving on the cost of materials in the process.",
    "prerequisites": "1 rank in appropriate Craft skill.",
    "benefit": "When you craft an item using your Craft skill, you can pay 1/5 of the item’s price for the raw material cost and craft a shoddy item (see page 116). You must still succeed at the appropriate DC check, and the work takes the same amount of time as a normal item. If you fail the Craft check by 5 or more, you ruin all the raw materials and must begin again. If you attempt to craft an item of even lower quality, the item’s poor quality is immediately apparent.",
    "normal": "You pay 1/3 of the item’s price for the raw material cost. If you fail the Craft check by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and must pay half the original raw material cost again. "
