    "benefit": "As a standard action, you can make a single attack with your chosen weapon while setting up a vortex of cuts that lasts until the beginning of your next turn. Any creature that begins its turn threatened by this weapon takes damage equal to your Strength or Dexterity bonus, whichever is greater. When your base attack bonus reaches +11, you also add your base weapon damage. When your base attack bonus reaches +16, you gain the distraction universal monster rule for this damage, but a creature that fails its save is only sickened. You can use this featâ€™s benefits only once per minute.",
