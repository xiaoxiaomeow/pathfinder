    "text": "You have the ability to create rare and valuable items from the bodies of fallen true dragons.",
    "prerequisites": "Craft (any) 5 ranks, Knowledge (arcana) 3 ranks.",
    "benefit": "You gain the ability to create a variety of dragoncraft items from materials gathered from the bodies of true dragons (not lesser dragons, such as linnorms or wyverns). Crafting dragoncraft items takes 1 hour per 100 gp of items being produced. In order to gather specimens from a dragon's corpse, you must succeed at a Heal check equal to 10 + the dragon's CR within 48 hours of the dragon's death (unless the body is preserved in some way). Refer to the table below to determine how much of a given material can be harvested from a dragon based on its size. <br><br> <table class=\"inner\"><tr><td>",
    "special": "Normally, if a suit of dragonhide armor has energy immunity, one may enhance such a suit with additional energy protection for the wearer at a 25% reduced cost. However, only effects with the same elemental type as the armorâ€™s immunity are eligible for this discount. An artisan with the Dragoncrafting feat may add 1 additional elemental protection to a suit of dragonhide armor at the same 25% discount, even if this energy resistance is not normally associated with the type of dragonhide being used."
