    "text": "Keeping a sailing vessel afloat means moving constantly between bright sunlight and darkened holds. You wear an eye patch, out of convenience rather than necessity, to make one of your eyes used to the dark and the other to the light.",
    "benefit": "If you are wearing an eye patch when you are dazzled or blinded as a result of eye damage or a visual stimulus (such as from fireworks or a glitterdust spell), you can remove or switch your eye patch as a move action to favor the eye you had kept covered. Switching your eye patch allows you to ignore the dazzled condition or to reduce the blinded condition to dazzled until the effect ends, at which time you regain the ability to use this feat.",

    "text_zh": "呆在一艘水上的帆船意味着会在明亮的日光和黑暗的船舱之间不断穿梭。尽管不是必要的，但为了方便，你还是会戴着一个眼罩，确保你有一只眼睛能习惯黑暗，而另一只则适应光亮。",
    "benefit_zh": "如果在你因为受伤或是视觉刺激（比如来自烟花UE或是闪光尘法术的效果）而目眩或是目盲时你穿戴着一个眼罩，你可以通过一个移动动作移除或转移眼罩，来让你之前被眼罩覆盖的眼睛恢复视力。转移眼罩能够让你忽略目眩，或是让你将目盲减弱为目眩，直到其影响结束为止，在这段时间内你不能再次使用这个专长。"
