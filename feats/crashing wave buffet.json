    "text": "You disorient your opponents by pushing and pounding them mercilessly, just like how the sea beats relentlessly against the rocks.",
    "prerequisites": "Wis 15, Crashing Wave Style, Improved Drag, Improved Reposition, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +6.",
    "benefit": "When dragging or repositioning an opponent, you use your full body to knock your opponent around like a constant wave. At the end of the drag or reposition maneuver, your opponent must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your character level + your Wisdom modifier + 2 for every 5 feet you drag or reposition your opponent). On a failed save, your opponent becomes disorientated from the movement and takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, and Dexterity-based skill checks until the end of its next turn.",

    "benefit_zh": "当你拖拽或移位对手的时候，你能像持续的波浪一般用全身来击打对手。在拖拽或移位的时候，你的对手必须进行一次强韧豁免检定（DC=10+1/2你的角色等级+你的感知调整+2每5尺拖拽或移位的距离）。若豁免失败，你的对手会迷失方向，并在攻击检定、战技检定和基于敏捷的技能检定上获得-2的罚值，直到他的下一次回合结束。"
