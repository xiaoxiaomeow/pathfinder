    "benefit": "When you wield a tankard as an improvised weapon in your off hand, it functions as a light mace, including for the purpose of determining the effects of feats like Weapon Focus. If you worship Cayden Cailean, your off-hand tankard functions as a divine focus and does not interfere with somatic spell components.<br><br> When you fight with two weapons and have the sickened condition, you do not apply the penalties from being sickened to attack rolls or weapon damage rolls.",
