    "text": "You have refined your ability to leap through the shadows.",
    "prerequisites": "Shadow jump shadowdancer class feature.",
    "benefit": "When you travel between shadows using the shadow jump ability, the minimum increment that you can jump is 5 feet, allowing you to split your shadow jumps into 5-foot increments instead of 10-foot increments. In addition, your shadow jump ability counts as the ability to cast <i>dimension door<\/i> for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of the Dimensional Agility feat as well as any feat that lists that feat as a prerequisite, and your shadow jump benefits from such feats as if you were casting <i>dimension door<\/i>.",
    "normal": "Each shadow jump, no matter how small, counts as a 10-foot increment."
