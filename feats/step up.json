    "benefit": "Whenever an adjacent foe attempts to take a 5-foot step away from you, you may also make a 5-foot step as an immediate action so long as you end up adjacent to the foe that triggered this ability. If you take this step, you cannot take a 5-foot step during your next turn. If you take an action to move during your next turn, subtract 5 feet from your total movement.",

    "staminaText": "As long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool, on the turn after you use this feat, you can still take a 5-foot step, and you don’t reduce your speed if you take an action to move due to this feat.",

    "benefit_zh": "每当一个邻近的敌人试图做一个五尺快步远离你时，你能以直觉动作也做一个五尺快步，只要你结束移动时和触发此能力的敌人相邻。如果你做了此种移动，你下一回合不能做五尺快步。如果你下一回合进行了移动，从你的总移动距离里面减去5尺。",
    "staminaText_zh": "只要你的耐力池中还有1点年里，在你使用这个专长后的那一回合中，你仍能做出5尺快步，并且你将不会因为这个专长而降低你在使用动作移动时的移动力。"
