    "benefit": "By completing a unique ritual, you can create a wyrwood. While you can use any Small wooden construct to create the base of a wyrwood, infusing it with life and consciousness requires a specific process. The process requires a flawless <i>ioun stone<\/i> worth at least 10,000 gp. For the ritual to succeed, you must spend 1 month in complete isolation with the construct that will become a wyrwood. Each week, you must succeed at a DC 30 Craft (carpentry) or Craft (sculpture) check. Failure requires you to start again, although the materials can be reused. Over this time, the construct reshapes itself around the <i>ioun stone<\/i> until it finds the form it will take permanently— thus even non-humanoid constructs become humanoid as they become wyrwoods. While wyrwoods are born as fully formed adults, they lack any skill or training, so they have only 1 level in the commoner class.",

    "benefit_zh": "通过完成一个独特的仪式，你可以创造一位汲魂木。虽然你可以使用任何小型木质构装体作为汲魂木的基础，但为它注入生命和意识需要特定的工序。这道工序需要一块价值至少10000gp的艾恩石，且你必须在一个月内与将要变成汲魂木的构装体完全孤立。你必须每周通过DC30的工艺（木工）或工艺（雕塑）检定，若你在检定中失败则需要重新开始，但这不会浪费材料。在这段时间中，构装体在艾恩石周围重塑自身，直到它选定了它将永久采用的形态，因此非人形的构装体也会在成为汲魂木的过程中变为人形。虽然汲魂木诞生时就已成年，但它缺乏技能和训练，因此只具有1级平民等级。"
