    "prerequisites": "Weapon Proficiency (crossbow type chosen) or Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearm).",
    "benefit": "The time required for you to reload your chosen type of weapon is reduced to a free action (for a hand or light crossbow), a move action (for heavy crossbow or one-handed firearm), or a standard action (two-handed firearm). Reloading a crossbow or firearm still provokes attacks of opportunity. <br><br> If you have selected this feat for a hand crossbow or light crossbow, you may fire that weapon as many times in a full-attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow.

    "normal": "A character without this feat needs a move action to reload a hand or light crossbow, a standard action to reload a one-handed firearm, or a full-round action to load a heavy crossbow or a two-handed firearm.",

    "staminaText": "When reloading a crossbow or firearm, you can spend 5 stamina points to reduce the reload time by one step; a standard action becomes a move action, a move action becomes a swift action, and a swift action becomes a free action. The weapon you are reloading doesn’t need to be the one you chose when you took this feat. If the weapon already has a reload time of one free action, when you make a full attack with the weapon, you can spend 2 stamina points to gain a +1 bonus on all damage rolls with the weapon during that full attack.",

    "mythicBenefit": "You gain the benefits of Rapid Reload with all crossbows and firearms, not just the one you originally chose when you gained that feat. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to gain the ability to reload crossbows and firearms without provoking attacks of opportunity for 1 minute.",

    "benefit_zh": "你可以用一个自由动作（手弩或轻弩）、移动动作（重弩或单手火器）或标准动作（双手火器）对你选择类型的武器进行装填。装填动作仍旧会引发借机攻击。如果你为这个专长选择了手弩或轻弩，你将可以像使用弓一样用其进行全回合攻击。",

    "staminaText_zh": "当你装填十字弓或者火器时，你可以消耗5点耐力来降低装填的时间一级；标准动作变为移动动作，移动动作变为迅捷动作，迅捷动作变为自由动作。你正在装填的武器不需要是你在获得这个专长时选择的。如果你的武器已经可以使用自由动作装填，当你用这件武器全力攻击时，你可以消耗2点耐力来在全力攻击时的伤害骰上获得+1加值。"
