    "source": ["Pathfinder #132: The Six-Legend Soul pg. 73"],
    "text": "Through training and persistence inspired by the Great Purge of Stavian I, you have learned to detect the sources of divine magic in such effects’ auras.",
    "prerequisites": "Ability to cast <i>detect magic<\/i> as a spell or spell-like ability.",
    "benefit": "When you use <i>detect magic<\/i> to determine the strength and location of the aura of a functioning spell, if that spell’s caster used a holy symbol as a divine focus to cast the spell, you see a ghostly image of the deity’s holy symbol as part of the spell’s aura. Effects that block divination spells or effects also block the effects of this feat."
