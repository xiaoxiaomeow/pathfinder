    "text": "You strike through the Ethereal Plane so your weapon phases through obstacles, armor, and even thick hide to strike true.",
    "prerequisites": "Knowledge (planes) 10 ranks.",
    "benefit": "As a move action, you can phase out one manufactured weapon or piece of ammunition you are holding. The next melee attack or thrown ranged attack you make with that weapon before the end of your turn is resolved as a touch attack and ignores cover, but does not ignore armor bonuses from force effects. You can attack through total cover this way, although you must still select the correct square for your target.<br><br> You can use this feat’s benefit once per day, plus an additional time per day for every 10 ranks you have in Knowledge (planes). This feat does not function on planes that are not coterminous with the Ethereal Plane.",

    "benefit_zh": "以一个移动动作,你可以放逐手中的一把人造武器或一枚弹药到灵界,在你的回合结束前你用该武器所做的下一次近战攻击或远程投掷攻击视为接触攻击并无视掩蔽,但此攻击无法忽视由力场效果带来的AC加值.按这种攻击方式,此次攻击可以穿过全掩蔽进行,但你必须选定你攻击目标所在的方格.<\/p><p>你可以获得本专长的好处每天一次,在知识(位面)上每有10级额外增加一次.本专长在与灵界位面不相接的位面里无法生效."
