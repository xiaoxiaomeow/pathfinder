If a creature within the splash area also has this feat, it automatically ignores splash damage from your splash weapons on a successful hit.<br><br> In addition, if you miss with a splash weapon and the errant weapon lands in a square occupied or adjacent to an ally with this feat, your ally can attempt a DC 20 Reflex save. If the ally succeeds, he is able to catch the weapon. If your ally also has the Snatch Arrows feat, he can toss the splash weapon back to you as an immediate action.",
