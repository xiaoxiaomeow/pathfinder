    "text": "You can remove poison from afflicted creatures.",
    "benefit": "As a full-round action, you can remove an injury poison from a helpless or willing creature’s bloodstream with a successful Heal check. The DC of this check is equal to the poison’s DC. You can only draw out poison in this way within the first 2 rounds of when the target was poisoned. If the check is successful, the creature no longer suffers any additional effects from the poison. By performing this action, you do not risk poisoning yourself.",

    "text_zh": "你可以从其他生物身上吸走毒素。",
    "benefit_zh": "以一个全轮动作，如果成功通过医疗技能鉴定，你可以将伤口型毒素一个无助或自愿生物的血中去除。该鉴定DC等同毒素DC。你只能在目标遭毒后的两轮内以此方式治疗。一旦鉴定成功便不再受到毒素的后继效果。你不会因此使自己中毒。"
