    "text": "The stomach-churning terror of your smothering attack leaves creatures sick and weakened.",
    "prerequisites": "Engulf or smother universal monster ability.",
    "benefit": "When you successfully engulf or smother an opponent, or successfully maintain a grapple combat maneuver on an engulfed or smothered opponent, that opponent must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Strength modifier) or become shaken for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect."
