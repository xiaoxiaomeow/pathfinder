    "source": ["Blood of the Night pg. 29"],
    "text": "You have learned the secret to changing the powers granted by your prayer scroll.",
    "prerequisites": "Jiang-shi.",
    "benefit": "You gain the ability to create a different type of prayer scroll. You may create a prayer scroll with this ability by using any strip of parchment and a writing instrument, but doing so requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted work. Swapping your current prayer scroll for a different prepared one is a standard action. When wearing a different prayer scroll, you gain its special abilities, but lose your normal prayer scroll’s immunity to spell completion and spell trigger magic items. Your prayer scrolls can be used only by you, and have no effect when used by other jiang-shis. When you choose this feat, select one of the following prayer scroll types.<br><br> <i>Embalmed Form<\/i>: This prayer scroll alters your physical form to how you looked 1 day before your death. Treat this as an <i>alter self <\/i>spell that affects you regardless of your original or current type; your caster level is equal to your Hit Dice. Your speed increases by 10 feet, but you lose your immunity to trip attacks and your ability to move through difficult terrain unhindered. These effects persist indefinitely as long as you wear the prayer scroll, but end immediately if you use a different prayer scroll or 24 hours after you remove this prayer scroll.<br><br> <i>Enduring Dust<\/i>: If you crumble into dust from hit point damage, you reform after 1 round instead of 1 minute. Scattering your dust does not prevent you from reforming as long none of your dust is more than 30 feet from any other part of your dust. Storing a portion of your dust in an air-tight container prevents you from reforming. If you are unable to reform after 1 minute, you are destroyed.<br><br> <i>Positive Energy Immunity<\/i>: You become immune to positive channeled energy used to harm undead. This does not protect you against positive energy from other sources such as cure spells or lay on hands.<br><br> <i>Spell Immunity<\/i>: The prayer scroll grants you immunity to a spell, as if you were using <i>spell immunity<\/i>. You decide which spell when you create the prayer scroll, and can choose a different spell each time you create a new spell immunity prayer scroll. If you have 15 or more Hit Dice, this functions as <i>greater spell immunity<\/i>. Creating this type of prayer scroll costs 100 gp × the spell level of the spell keyed to the scroll.",
    "special": "You may select this feat multiple times. Each time you do so, choose another ability granted by the feat.",
    "name_zh": "各种护尸符",
    "text_zh": "你了解了改变你护尸符能力的秘密。",
    "benefit_zh": "你获得制造不同种类护尸符的能力。你可以使用羊皮纸和书写工具来创造新的护尸符，这需要10分钟的连续工作。给自己换一个准备好的护尸符是一个标准动作。当你贴上护尸符，就获得其特殊能力，但失去你原本的护尸符能力（免疫记录型法术和使用性法术效果）。你的护尸符仅可以被你自己使用，别的僵尸使用起来没有任何效果。当你获得本专长，选择一种护尸符能力。<\/p><p>防腐形态(Embalmed Form)：本护尸符将你的肉体形态改变为你死去前一天的样子。这视为一个变形自己(alter self)效果，除了它无视你原本和现在的生物类型，效果的CL=你的HD。你的速度增加10尺。你失去对拌摔的免疫以及无视困难地形的能力。只要你贴着护尸符，这些效果就一直持续。改变护尸符会立即终止本效果。摘下本护尸符后24小时，这些效果也会终止。<\/p><p>持恒沙尘(Enduring Dust)：若你由于HP伤害崩解成沙子，可以在1轮而非1分钟后重塑。将沙子吹散无法阻止你重塑，只要这些沙子都在30尺的范围内。将一些沙子放到气密容器里会阻止你重塑。若你在1分钟后还没能重塑，你就被摧毁了。<\/p><p>正能量免疫(Positive Energy Immunity)：你对用来伤害不死生物的引导正能量免疫。这不会保护你不受其它来源的正能量伤害。<\/p><p>法术免疫(Spell Immunity)：此护尸符可以使你免疫一个法术，如同你被加持了法术免疫(spell immunity)这个法术。你在创造护尸符的时候决定免疫什么法术，每次创造护尸符可以选择不同的法术。若你有15个或更多的HD，此符如同高等法术免疫(greater spell immunity)一般运作。制作此符的成本是100gp*目标法术等级。",
