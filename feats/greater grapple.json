    "text": "Maintaining a grapple is second nature to you.",
    "prerequisites": "Improved Grapple, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +6, Dex 13.",
    "benefit": "You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to grapple a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by Improved Grapple. Once you have grappled a creature, maintaining the grapple is a move action. This feat allows you to make two grapple checks each round (to move, harm, or pin your opponent), but you are not required to make two checks. You only need to succeed at one of these checks to maintain the grapple.",
    "normal": "Maintaining a grapple is a standard action.",
    "staminaSource": "Pathfinder Unchained pg. 121",
    "staminaText": "After you take a move action to successfully maintain a grapple, you can spend 5 stamina points before the end of your turn to maintain that grapple as a swift action. This allows you to make up to three grapple checks to maintain a grapple during a round, but you still can’t maintain a grapple until the round after you initiate it.",

    "benefit_zh": "你在擒抱检定中获得+2加值，此加值与“精通擒抱”专长带来的加值累计。每当你成功擒抱一个生物，维持擒抱是一个移动动作。本专长允许你每轮进行两次擒抱检定（移动、伤害或压制你的对手），但你仅需要检定成功其中一次便可以维持擒抱。",
    "normal_zh": "维持擒抱是一个标准动作。",
    "staminaText_zh": "在你成功使用移动动作维持擒抱时，你可以在你回合结束之前以一个迅捷动作使用5点耐力。这让你可以在一轮内做至多3次检定来维持擒抱，但只有在你启动擒抱的下一轮后才能使用。"
