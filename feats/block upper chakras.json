    "benefit": "When you use Block Chakras, you can also select from the heart, throat, brow, and crown chakras, as long as you can open the chosen chakra yourself, with the following effects.<br><br> <i>Heart<\/i>: The target can’t recover hit points from any source for 1 minute. This prevents hit point recovery from fast healing and regeneration but doesn’t deactivate regeneration altogether, so it does not allow a creature with regeneration to be killed through hit point damage. On a successful save, the target recovers only half as many hit points for 1 round.<br><br> <i>Throat<\/i>: The target can’t speak or cast spells with a thought component for 1 round, and for 1 minute, actions that require speaking or thought components have a 20% chance to fail. On a successful save, actions that require speaking or thought components have a 50% chance to fail for 1 round.<br><br> <i>Brow<\/i>: The target is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, the target loses all special forms of vision (such as lowlight vision, see in darkness, and true seeing) for 1 round; this doesn’t affect nonvisual senses like blindsight and blindsense.<br><br> <i>Crown<\/i>: The target must roll twice and take the lower result on all d20 rolls for 1 round and on its first attack roll or caster level check each round for 1 minute. On a successful save, the target must roll twice and take the lower result on its next d20 roll.",
