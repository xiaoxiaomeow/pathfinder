    "text": "You have mastered the impenetrable Aldori fighting style.",
    "prerequisites": "Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Aldori dueling sword), Quick Draw, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus (Aldori dueling sword).",
    "benefit": "You gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks as long as you start combat with an Aldori dueling sword in your hand. As long as you wield only a single Aldori dueling sword in one hand (not using a shield, an off-hand weapon, armor spikes, unarmed strikes, or natural weapons), you gain a +2 shield bonus to your AC. If you wield the sword in two hands, this bonus drops to a +1 shield bonus to AC. Although the dueling sword deals slashing damage, you treat it as if it were also a piercing weapon when determining the effects of weapons used by a duelist or swashbuckler.",

    "benefit_zh": "只要你在手持奥多里决斗剑时开始战斗，你便能在先攻检定上获得+2加值。只要你持有且仅用一只手持有一把奥多里决斗剑，你在AC上获得+2盾牌加值——若你用双手持用该剑，AC加值下降为+1盾牌加值。尽管决斗剑造成的是挥砍伤害，你在决定由决斗家持用武器的效果时，也会同时将其视为一把穿刺武器。",
    "staminaText_zh": "你可以在你回合开始的时候消耗至多6点耐力来提升你从奥多里决斗大师专长上获得的盾牌加值，每消耗2点耐力就能提升1点，这将持续到你的下一回合开始。"
