    "text": "Your electricity spells tire their targets.",
    "benefit": "Whenever you cast a spell with the electricity descriptor that targets one or more creatures, you can take a –1 penalty on attack rolls made with the spell and reduce the spell’s saving throw DC by 1 to cause the target closest to you that is dealt electricity damage by the spell to become fatigued for 1 round. This cannot cause a creature that is already fatigued to become exhausted. You must choose to use this feat before making an attack roll or before your target attempts its saving throw. This feat has no effect on spells that neither allow a saving throw nor require an attack roll.",

    "text_zh": "你的闪电法术让你的目标疲惫。",
    "benefit_zh": "当你释放一个带有【电】描述符的法术并以一个或多个生物为目标时，你可以选择在该法术攻击骰上承受-1罚值并降低法术豁免DC1，使得受到该法术闪电伤害且离你最近的目标疲乏1轮。该效果并不能使已经疲乏的生物变得力竭。你必须在进行攻击骰或在你的目标尝试进行豁免骰之前选择是否使用该专长。该专长对那些既不需要攻击骰又不需要进行豁免的法术无效。"
