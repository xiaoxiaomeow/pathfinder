    "source": ["Haunted Heroes Handbook pg. 5"],
    "text": "You have learned to assuage monstrous predators with special offerings.",
    "benefit": "A number of times per day equal to 3 + your  Wisdom modifier, you can prepare a special offering. This takes 5 minutes and at least 5 gp worth of foodstuffs, spices, and other ingredients; a prepared offering lasts 8 hours before spoiling. You can present this offering to a nonhumanoid creature (even one which doesn’t normally  consume food) as a standard action. The offering’s ingredients must be worth at least 5 gp × the creature’s CR. This offering improves its attitude toward you by one step unless it succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your level + your Wisdom modifier). This attitude adjustment lasts only 5 minutes unless the creature’s attitude is adjusted further during that time, such as via the Diplomacy skill. A specific creature cannot be affected by an offering made in this way more than once per 24 hours."
