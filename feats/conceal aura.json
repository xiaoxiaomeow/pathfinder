    "text": "You can weaken your alignment aura to hide the true extent of your faith.",
    "prerequisites": "Chaotic, evil, good, or lawful alignment.",
    "benefit": "As a full-round action, you can reduce the power of the aura generated by your alignment for 1 minute. During this time, for the purposes of spells that detect alignment, your aura’s power is lessened by one step (for example, if you are a 12th-level neutral good fighter, your aura power is faint rather than moderate). You also gain a +2 bonus on Bluff checks to send secret messages.",

    "text_zh": "你可以通过消弱你的阵营灵光来隐藏你真实的信仰归属。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "守序、混乱、善良或邪恶阵营。",
    "benefit_zh": "以一个整轮动作，你可以压制你产生的阵营灵光，持续1分钟。为了应对侦测阵营，你的灵光会降低一阶（例如，若你是12级善良中立战士，你的灵光变为昏暗而非中等）。在传递秘密信息的唬骗检定中你也获得+2加值。"
