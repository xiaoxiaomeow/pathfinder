    "text": "You are especially hard to kill. Not only do your wounds automatically stabilize when grievously injured, but you can remain conscious and continue to act even at death's door.",
    "prerequisites": "Endurance.",
    "benefit": "When your hit point total is below 0, but you are not dead, you automatically stabilize. You do not need to make a Constitution check each round to avoid losing additional hit points. You may choose to act as if you were disabled, rather than dying. You must make this decision as soon as you are reduced to negative hit points (even if it isn't your turn). If you do not choose to act as if you were disabled, you immediately fall unconscious.<br><br>When using this feat, you are staggered. You can take a move action without further injuring yourself, but if you perform any standard action (or any other action deemed as strenuous, including some swift actions, such as casting a quickened spell) you take 1 point of damage after completing the act. If your negative hit points are equal to or greater than your Constitution score, you immediately die.",
    "normal": "A character without this feat who is reduced to negative hit points is unconscious and dying.",

    "text_zh": "你尤其难以被杀掉。你不但在受到极其严重的伤害时伤势会自动稳定下来，还能够保持清醒并继续行动，即便已经摸到了死亡的门坎。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "坚忍。",
    "benefit_zh": "当HP降至0以下，但还没有死亡时，你可以自动稳定伤势，不须每回合作体质检定避免HP流失。你可以选择如同瘫痪状态一般行动，而非濒死。你必须在HP降至负数时立刻决定是否采取瘫痪状态的动作，若否，你将立刻陷入昏迷。使用本专长时，你视同恍惚状态。你每轮可以进行一次移动动作且不受任何额外伤害，但标准动作（或任何其他费力的行动，包括某些迅捷动作，例如施展瞬发法术）将使你在动作完成受到1点伤害。当你的HP负值降至等于或超过你的体质值，你将立刻死亡。",
    "normal_zh": "没有本专长的人物在HP降至负值时为昏迷且濒死状态。"
