    "text": "With no other allies to enjoy your performance, you improvise to make it more inspiring for yourself.",
    "prerequisites": "Perform (any) 3 ranks, bardic performance or raging song class feature.",
    "benefit": "Whenever you are the only creature affected by a bardic performance or raging song that normally affects all allies within a range, any bonuses granted by your bardic performance or raging song are calculated as though your class level were 4 higher. This feat does not allow you to activate a bardic performance or raging song if your actual class level is not high enough to use that performance.",

    "text_zh": "当没有其他盟友享受你的表演时，你将通过即兴创作来让它变得更能激励你自己。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "表演（任意）3级，吟游表演或者战怒之歌职业特性。",
    "benefit_zh": "当你是唯一一个被通常能够影响范围内所有盟友所影响的生物时，所有由吟游表演或者战歌赋予你的加值都将会被以高于你现在职业等级4级来计算。当你的实际职业等级并不足以激活某些吟游表演或战歌时，这个专长也不能让你激活它们。"
