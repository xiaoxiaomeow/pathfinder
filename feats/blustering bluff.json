    "source": ["Ultimate Intrigue pg. 75"],
    "text": "You can verbally bully others into believing unlikely or outrageous lies.",
    "prerequisites": "Cha 13, Bluff 1 rank, Intimidate 1 rank.",
    "benefit": "When using Bluff to fool a foe, you can bully that person to reduce the penalty for telling an unlikely or far-fetched lie by 5. If you do so and your check would not have succeeded otherwise, after 1d6×10 minutes, the person you fooled realizes you bullied him into believing a lie, treats you as unfriendly, and might report you or take other actions against you.",
    "normal": "The penalty for telling unlikely lies is –5, and the penalty for telling far-fetched lies is –10.",
    "name_zh": "虚张声势",
    "text_zh": "你能够以强势的口吻让他人相信离谱的谎言。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "魅力 13，唬骗1级，威吓1级。",
    "benefit_zh": "当你使用唬骗欺骗1名敌人时，可以用盛气凌人地对该生物叫嚷，使得讲出不太可靠（unlikely）或过于牵强（far-fetched）的谎言带来的减值降低5点。若你这么做且检定并失败的话，在1d6 x 10分钟以后，被你愚弄的生物才会意识到你试图欺凌唬骗它，其对你的态度会变为不友善（treats you as unfriendly），而且可能会告发你或者对你采取其他行动。",
    "normal_zh": "说出不太可靠（unlikely）的谎言的减值为-5点，过于牵强（far-fetched）的谎言的减值为-10点。"
