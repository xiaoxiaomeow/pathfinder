You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a scarring spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).<br><br> When you use a scarring spell-like ability, a target that fails its saving throw against the spell-like ability takes a –2 penalty on saving throws against emotion and fear effects you create, and a –1 penalty on saving throws against other emotion and fear effects, for the next 24 hours. If the spelllike ability doesn’t allow a saving throw, you can’t choose to enhance it with this feat. Penalties from multiple scarring spell-like abilities don’t stack. This feat can be applied only to spell-like abilities with the emotion or fear descriptor.<br><br> You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) – 1. For a summary, see Table 3–1.",
