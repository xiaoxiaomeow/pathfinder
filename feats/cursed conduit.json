    "benefit": "You are not compelled to keep or use cursed items you touch so long as your character level is equal to or higher than the itemâ€™s caster level. You are still affected by the afflictions of any cursed item you carry or use, but you gain a bonus on saving throws against curse effects equal to one-third the caster level of the highest-level cursed item you carry."
