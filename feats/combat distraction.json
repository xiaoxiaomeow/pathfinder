    "source": ["Goblins of Golarion pg. 25"],
    "text": "Anyone who attacks you while you act like a lunatic exposes themselves to brutal counterattacks from your allies.",
    "prerequisites": "Goblin, Acrobatics 1 rank, Escape Artist 1 rank.",
    "benefit": "As a full-round action, you can choose to do something that seems to serve no useful purpose. Example actions could include laughing at another creature’s misfortune, rooting in your pockets for a snack, bending over to pick up what looks like a weird bug, or trying to fly into the air by flapping your arms like a sea gull.Although you’re acting like a lunatic, your unpredictable actions are distracting. Any creature other than a goblin within 5 feet of you takes a –2 penalty on Perception checks and concentration checks for as long as you continue to be a distraction and remain in range. This penalty stacks with other goblins performing combat distractions, as long as you’re both adjacent to the distracted target."
