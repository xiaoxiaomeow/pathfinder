    "benefit": "When you gain this feat, choose one arcane school power that you can use to affect no more than one opponent. If you make a successful unarmed strike against an opponent, in addition to dealing your unarmed strike damage, you can use a swift action to deliver the effects of the chosen school power to that opponent. Doing so provokes no attacks of opportunity.",

    "staminaText_zh": "在你使用徒手击打命中后，你可以消耗2点耐力来以一个自由动作而不是迅捷动作来使用你所选择的奥术学派之力的效果。"
