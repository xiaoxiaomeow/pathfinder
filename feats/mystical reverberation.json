    "benefit": "As a standard action, select an ally within 30 feet who also has this feat and select a metamagic feat you have. If that ally doesn’t have the selected metamagic feat, she can modify a spell she casts before the end of her next turn with that metamagic feat. The spell is modified as normal, except it uses a spell slot 1 additional level above the normal spell level modification for that metamagic feat.<br><br> If the selected ally does have the metamagic feat you select, she can instead use that feat to modify a spell she casts before the end of her next turn without increasing the spell’s casting time."
