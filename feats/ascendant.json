    "benefit": "You and your apparent allies gain a +2 bonus on skill checks to gain influence (<i>Ultimate Intrigue 102<\/i>) or request a favor.

Additionally, the DC of Sense Motive checks to get hunches about you and your apparent allies increases by 2.",
    "goal": "Achieve a position in a high social class (such as the nobility) or an esteemed military position (such as general) without any substantiated rumors impugning your reputation.
