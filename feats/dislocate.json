    "text": "You can dislocate your limbs to aid in escaping from bonds or enemy grips.",
    "prerequisites": "Con 13.",
    "benefit": "As a swift action, you can deal 1d8 points of nonlethal damage to yourself as you pop your joints from their sockets, making yourself more flexible though suffering incredible pain. Any Escape Artist checks you attempt that would normally take 1 minute instead take 1 full-round action. If you have 7 Hit Dice or more, the damage you deal to yourself is decreased to 1d6. If you have 14 Hit Dice or more, you deal no damage to yourself, and any Escape Artist checks you attempt that normally take 1 full round instead take a move action. You can't gain any benefits from this feat if you are immune to nonlethal damage.",
