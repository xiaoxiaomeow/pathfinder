    "url": "https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Flow%20of%20Elements",
    "descriptors": ["Teamwork"],
    "source": ["Inner Sea Races pg. 206"],
    "text": "You can spontaneously channel your ally’s elemental essence, be it burning fire, freezing ice, crackling lightning, or searing acid.",
    "prerequisites": "Ability to cast spells; ifrit, oread, sylph, or undine.",
    "benefit": "Whenever you’re adjacent to an ifrit, oread, sylph, or undine ally who also has this feat, you can spontaneously replace or split a spell’s damage when casting it, as though the spell were affected by Elemental Spell (without using a higher-level spell slot). The type of energy damage depends on your ally’s race: acid for oread, electricity for sylph, fire for ifrit, or cold for undine."
