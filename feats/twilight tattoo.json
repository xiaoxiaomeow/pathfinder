    "text": "You have a special tattoo that identifies you as a Twilight Talon when you speak a designated command word.",
    "prerequisites": "Wis 13, affiliated with the Twilight Talons.",
    "benefit": "You gain an invisible magical tattoo that identifies you as a member of the Twilight Talons. When you speak the command word, the tattoo becomes visible for 1 round before fading again. The tattoo has no magical aura when not visible and is not an illusion; it can’t be observed through magical means. (The command word causes the tattoo to manifest rather than ending the magic concealing it.)<br><br> Additionally, you gain a +2 bonus on Disguise checks, on Sleight of Hand checks to hide small objects on your person, and on Will saving throws against attempts to scry upon you or read your mind.",

    "benefit_zh": "你获得一个隐形的魔法纹身，可以证明你是暮光之爪的一员。当你说出命令词时，这个纹身会在重新褪色之前显形一轮。这个纹身在不显形时没有魔法灵光，并且不是幻术，它不能通过魔法手段观察。（命令词会使纹身显形而不是结束隐藏它的魔法。）此外，你在易容检定、在身上隐藏小型物品的巧手检定，以及对抗尝试探知你或者阅读你思维的意志豁免上获得+2加值。"
