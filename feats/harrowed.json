    "benefit": "You get a +1 bonus on all Will saves made to resist enchantment effects. Once per day, you may draw a card from a Harrow deck you own. At any one time for the rest of that day, you may apply a +2 bonus on any d20 roll modified by the card’s suit. For example, if you drew a card from the suit of Dexterity, you could apply this +2 bonus on an Initiative check, a Reflex save, a Dexterity-based skill check, or a ranged attack roll. You may assign this +2 bonus after you make the roll, but you must do so before you know whether the roll was a success or not.",

    "benefit_zh": "你在对抗附魔效果时所有的意志豁免获得+1加值。每日1次，你能够从自己的哈罗套牌中抽取一张卡。在当天剩下时间的任意一刻，你能够在任何一次d20检定中获得+2加值，能获得加值的检定类型由卡牌的花色决定。例如，如果你抽出一张敏捷花色的卡，那么你可以在一次先攻检定，反射检定，基于敏捷的技能检定或者一次远程攻击检定中获得+2加值。你能够在进行检定之后将+2加值分配到结果上，但是你必须在知道检定成功与否之前这么做。"
