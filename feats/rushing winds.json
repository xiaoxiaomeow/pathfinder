    "text": "You can fly through the air at high speed, creating a column of wind in your path that destabilizes other fliers.",
    "prerequisites": "Turbulent Takeoff, Fly 10 ranks.",
    "benefit": "As a full-round action, you can fly up to twice your Fly speed in a straight line, creating a shockwave of rushing winds around you as you move. Each flying creature you pass adjacent to as part of this movement must succeed at a DC 25 Fly check or be blown back 1d6×10 feet and take 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting. Creatures that fail this check by 5 or more also lose 1d4×10 feet of altitude, and creatures that fail this check by 10 or more plummet to the ground.",
