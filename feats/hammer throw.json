    "prerequisites": "Int 13, Combat Expertise, Improved Trip, Point-Blank Shot, Precise Shot, base attack bonus +1, dwarf.",
    "benefit": "As a standard action, you can make a single ranged attack with a weapon that deals bludgeoning damage against a creature no more than one size category larger than you that is within the weaponâ€™s first range increment. If you hit and damage the target, you can immediately attempt to perform a trip combat maneuver against that target. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity, and if your combat maneuver check fails by 10 or more, you do not fall prone.",
