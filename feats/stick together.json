    "benefit": "When an adjacent ally with this feat moves, you can move up to your speed as an immediate action, as long as your movement ends adjacent to that ally. If you do so, you are staggered on your next turn. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.",

    "text_zh": "战斗中，你紧跟盟友的脚步。",
    "benefit_zh": "当一个拥有该专长的邻接你的盟友移动时，你可以一个直觉动作移动最多等于你速度的距离，最终停留点必须仍邻接那位盟友。若你如此做，在你下一回合你将会恍惚。该种移动正常引发借机攻击。"
