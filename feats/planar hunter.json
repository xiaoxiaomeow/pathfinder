    "source": ["Champions of Balance pg. 13"],
    "text": "After careful study of otherworldly environments, you can quickly evaluate how an outsider reacts in its home surroundings. You can use your knowledge of the outsider’s native environment to guide your attacks and overcome the outsider’s natural resistances.",
    "prerequisites": "Knowledge (planes) 5 ranks, favored terrain (any plane) class feature.",
    "benefit": "When you are on one of the planes you’ve selected as a favored terrain, you gain a +2 bonus on weapon attack rolls against outsiders native to that plane. You also ignore up to 5 points of damage reduction when making weapon attacks against outsiders native to that plane, except for damage reduction without a type (such as DR 10/—). In addition, you gain this bonus against extraplanar creatures you encounter and identify as being from one of your planar favored terrains, such as with a successful Knowledge (planes) check, regardless of what plane you or they are on.",
    "special": "You may select this feat multiple times. Each time you take it, you apply it to a different qualifying favored terrain.",
    "name_zh": "位面猎手",
    "text_zh": "在仔细研究过异界环境之后，你能够快速归纳出异界生物与其家园环境互动的方式。你透过自己对于异界生物原生环境的这份认知来调整自己的攻击，穿透异界生物天生的抗性。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "知识（位面）5级，偏好地形（任意位面）职业特性。",
    "benefit_zh": "当你位于你选为偏好地形的其中一个位面时，你对该位面原生的异界生物进行的攻击投骰获得+2加值。你对该位面原生的异界生物进行武器攻击时，可以忽略最多5点伤害减免，但不能忽略无类型的伤害减免。此外，当你遭遇跨位面生物，并辨认出它来自于你其中一个位面偏好地形（例如成功通过知识（位面）检定）时，无论你或它们位于哪个位面，你都可以获得此加值。",
    "special_zh": "你可以多次选择此专长。每次选择时，将其应用于一个满足条件的不同偏好地形。"
