    "prerequisites": "Acrobatics 1 rank, vanara.",
    "benefit": "You gain a +2 bonus to your CMD against all trip attacks. If your square has a branch or other sturdy large object that you could hang from, as a swift action you may make a DC 15 Acrobatics check to jump upward and use your tail to hang from that object. While hanging, you can’t be tripped, you ignore the effects of difficult terrain in your square, and you gain a +2 bonus to your CMD against bull rush, drag, and reposition attacks. If you leave that square (including if you are moved against your will), you lose your grip on the object and are no longer hanging. While hanging, you cannot use your tail for anything else.",

    "staminaText_zh": "当你向上跳起并把你的尾巴挂在一个物体上时，你可以消耗至多5点耐力。你会在特技检定上获得等同于你消耗耐力点数的加值。"
