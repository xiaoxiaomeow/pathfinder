    "benefit": "As a standard action, you can attempt a combat maneuver check against a creature no more than one size category larger than yourself. This provokes an attack of opportunity from the target of the maneuver. If the check is successful, you can prevent the target from using one arm (or similar limb) or one natural attack of your choice for 1 round. For every 5 by which your check result exceeds the target’s CMD, the affected arm or natural attack is unusable for 1 additional round. The target can regain the use of its disabled limb or natural attack by taking a standard action to do so.",
