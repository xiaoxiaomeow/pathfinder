    "descriptors": ["Story"],
    "source": ["Ultimate Campaign pg. 73"],
    "text": "You search for a person dear to you—lost, but you pray not dead.",
    "prerequisites": "You must have a close relative, spouse, or other person dear to your heart who never returned from a journey, was captured, or otherwise vanished with little trace, or you have the Major Disaster background.",
    "benefit": "Your dogged determination reduces any nonlethal damage you take by 1 point, to a minimum of 1 point of nonlethal damage. You also gain a +1 bonus on Will saves.",
    "goal": "Find your lost loved one alive, and in the process, decisively defeat a challenging foe who kept you apart.",
    "completionBenefit": "You gain a +1 bonus on all saving throws, replacing the +1 bonus on Will saves. If you find your loved one dead, you lose all benefits from this feat until you put the body and possibly soul to proper rest. Putting the body to rest restores the completion benefit, but you don’t regain the ability to reduce nonlethal damage.",
    "name_zh": "莫失莫忘",
    "text_zh": "你在追寻着自己的重要之人——你衷心地期盼他/她尚在人间。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "你必须有一位近亲、配偶或其他贴心人在一次旅行中未归、被绑走或以其他形式消失得无影无踪；或你拥有“劫后余生（Major Disaster）”角色背景。",
    "benefit_zh": "你的坚定信念令你受到的非致命伤害降低1点，最低降至1点。同时你的意志豁免+1。",
    "goal_zh": "找到你的所爱之人，并在追寻的过程中完胜一个阻挠你们的强大敌手。",
    "completionBenefit_zh": "取代意志豁免+1，你的全豁免+1。如果你发现所爱之人已逝，你将失去本专长的所有收益，直到你给予遗体和灵魂适当的安息。葬下遗体后你可获得本完成收益，但依然失去降低非致命伤害的能力。"
