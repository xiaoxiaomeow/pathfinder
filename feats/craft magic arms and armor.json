To enhance a weapon, suit of armor, or shield, you must use up raw materials costing half of this total price. See the magic item creation rules in Magic Items for more information.<br><br>The weapon, armor, or shield to be enhanced must be a masterwork item that you provide. Its cost is not included in the above cost.<br><br>You can also mend a broken magic weapon, suit of armor, or shield if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the raw materials and half the time it would take to craft that item in the first place.",
