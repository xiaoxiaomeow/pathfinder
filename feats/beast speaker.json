Their entries and advancement are the same as for animal companions, with two exceptions. First, creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher have one or more additional prerequisites the character must meet to select the companion. Second, each beast companion has a mastery ability that it can use only if the character it is bonded to has the Beast Speaker Mastery feat. The minimum level to gain this ability is listed in parentheses. The save DC for any of a beast companion’s special abilities is 10 + half the beast companion’s HD + the beast companion’s Constitution modifier. "
