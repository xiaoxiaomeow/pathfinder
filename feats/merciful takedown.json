    "text": "You are adept at removing your defeated opponents from the fight while avoiding their deaths.",
    "benefit": "When you perform a coup de grace and deal only nonlethal damage, instead of attempting a Fortitude save to avoid death, the target must instead attempt a Fortitude save to avoid falling unconscious for 1 hour. The DC of this save is the same as that of a lethal coup de grace."
