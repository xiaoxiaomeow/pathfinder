    "source": ["Technology Guide pg. 7"],
    "text": "You can extract a charge from otherwise depleted technology.",
    "prerequisites": "Disable Device 5 ranks, Knowledge (engineering) 5 ranks",
    "benefit": "With a successful DC 20 Disable Device check, you can jury-rig a depleted (but not destroyed) battery so it provides 1 more charge. Using this charge or failing your check by 5 or more permanently depletes the battery. <br><br>You can attempt the same check to add 1 last charge to a discharged piece of timeworn technology. Regardless of the outcome, no other attempts can be made, even by another person. Using this feat takes 1 minute. You can attempt to wrest a charge as a move action by taking a â€“10 penalty on your check. This feat does not stack with the charge cycling deed."
