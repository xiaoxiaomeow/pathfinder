    "text": "You can infuse your spells with the ability to cripple your targets with old age or regress them to the folly of youth.",
    "benefit": "When a living creature takes damage from the affected spell, that creature also takes 2 points of damage to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution or 2 points of damage to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma (your choice). If the spell does not normally allow a save, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the effect. Ageless or immortal creatures are immune to this effect. This is a magical aging effect, but it does not alter the creature’s true age—it merely simulates the effects of old age on the flesh or the reversion to a more infantile mental age. A cherry blossom spell uses up a slot 3 levels higher than the spell’s actual level. Spells that don’t deal damage don’t benefit from this feat."
