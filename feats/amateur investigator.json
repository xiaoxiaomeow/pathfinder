    "url": "https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Amateur%20Investigator",
    "source": ["Advanced Class Guide pg. 141"],
    "text": "Your knowledge is more than plain smarts—it’s inspired.",
    "prerequisites": "Int 13, 1 rank in at least one Knowledge skill, no levels in a class that has the inspiration class feature.",
    "benefit": "Like an investigator, you have the ability to augment your Knowledge, Linguistics, and Spellcraft skill checks. You gain a pool of inspiration equal to your Intelligence modifier. You can expend one use of inspiration as a free action to add 1d6 to the result of a Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft check, as long as you are trained in that skill (even if you take 10 or 20 on that check). You make this choice after the check is rolled and before the results of the roll are revealed. You can use inspiration only once per skill check. Your pool of inspiration refreshes each day, typically after you get a restful night’s sleep.",
    "special": "If you gain levels in a class that has the inspiration class feature, you can immediately trade this feat for the Extra Inspiration feat.",
    "name_zh": "业余调查员",
    "text_zh": "你拥有的知识和灵感已经足够用来解决神秘事件。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "智力13，至少在一个知识技能上拥有技能等级，在拥有灵感（Inspiration）职业能力的职业上不具有任何等级。",
    "benefit_zh": "你获得一个大小等同于你智力调整值的灵感池，如同调查员的灵感一样，你可以以一个自由动作使用一点灵感点数，再已受训的知识，语言学或辨识法术技能检定上增加1d6点结果（即使你在这项检定上取10或取20也可以），但你必须在进行检定但得出结果以前使用此能力。你在每次技能检定上只能使用最多1点灵感点数。你的灵感池会在每天的完整休息以后得到恢复。",
    "special_zh": "如果你在拥有灵感职业能力的职业上获得了职业等级，那么本专长将立刻替换为额外灵感专长。"
