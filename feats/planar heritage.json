    "text": "You can trace your ancestry to a type of native outsider, even though you yourself are otherwise fully human.",
    "prerequisites": "Human.",
    "benefit": "Choose one type of native outsider (such as ganzi). You count as both human and that race for any effects related to race. For example, if you choose ganzi, you are considered both a human and a ganzi for the purposes of taking traits, meeting feat prerequisites, determining how spells and magic items affect you, and so on. You must have the requisite physical features to gain certain benefits, as determined by the GM (for example, you cannot gain feats that augment your tail’s abilities if you do not actually have a tail).",

    "benefit_zh": "选择一种本地异界生物种族（例如：熵裔）。在判断任何与种族相关的效果时，你将同时视为人类和那个种族。例如，你选择熵裔，那么在选取背景特性、满足专长先决条件、确定法术和魔法物品的效果等等情况时，你被同时视为人类和熵裔。<\/p><p>你必须拥有必要的身体特征才能获得某些效果，这由GM决定（例如，你不是真正拥有一条尾巴，你就无法获得强化你尾巴能力的专长）。",
    "special_zh": "如果你已经拥有了一种以这样的方式来调整你种族的能力或专长（例如：远古血脉），那么你无法选择位面血脉。"
