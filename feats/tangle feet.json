    "text": "Creatures who cross your path find themselves tripping over their own feet.",
    "prerequisites": "Dodge, Mobility, Underfoot, goblin, Small size or smaller.",
    "benefit": "When you successfully make an Acrobatics check to avoid provoking an attack of opportunity from a larger opponent when you move through its threatened area or its space, you can make that opponent lose its balance until the end of its next turn as a free action. While that creature’s balance is lost, if it attempts to move, it must make a successful DC 15 Acrobatics check or fall prone, wasting the move action. You can only affect one creature with this effect each round.",

    "staminaText": "When you make an opponent lose its balance with this feat, you can spend 2 stamina points to increase the DC of its Acrobatics check to avoid falling prone to 20.",

    "staminaText_zh": "当你使用这个专长让一个对手失去平衡时，你可以消耗2点耐力来提升避免俯卧所需要特技检定DC，这个DC将会提升至20。"
