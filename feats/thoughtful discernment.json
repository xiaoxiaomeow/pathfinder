    "benefit": "Once per day as a free action, you can think back about a single statement you heard in the last day and determine if it was a lie. This acts like the <i>discern lies <\/i>spell, but instead of affecting a creature, it affects a single statement a creature has made. <br><br> For example, if the king told you, “My daughter is in the monster’s dungeon” before you left to find her, as long as the king said that to you within the past day, you can use this feat to determine whether or not the king deliberately and knowingly lied to you when he made that statement.",

    "prerequisites_zh": "【辨识谎言】职业特性。",
    "benefit_zh": "每天以一个自由动作，你可以回想一句你在当天听过的话并且识别其是否谎言。这个行动就如同一个‘辨识谎言’法术，但是用一句句子代替了一个生物。例如，如果国王告诉你：“我的女儿正在地下城里。”在你前往地下城之前，并且国王是在过去的1天之内对你说了这句话的，那么你就可以用这一专长来辨明国王在做此发言时是说的是真话还是假话。"
