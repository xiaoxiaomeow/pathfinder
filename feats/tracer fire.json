    "benefit": "As a standard action, you can make a single ranged attack at your highest base attack bonus with an illuminated throwing weapon or piece of ammunition, such as a <i>flaming<\/i> shuriken or an arrow imbued with a magical light effect. If the attack hits its target, attacks against the same target gain a +2 circumstance bonus for 1 round, so long as those attacks originate in dim light or darker areas. The target counts as being in bright light until the projectile is removed or extinguished. Removing the projectile is a move action that provokes an attack of opportunity.",
