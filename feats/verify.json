    "benefit": "You gain a +5 bonus on Sense Motive checks to determine whether a creature is lying when you ask if it has followed the terms of a contract or deal to which it formally agreed. This includes all written and signed contracts, but also such things as witnessed oaths of loyalty and guild charters.<br><br> If you succeed at such a Sense Motive check and learn that a creature has violated any part of such a formal bargain, that creature takes a â€“2 penalty on saving throws against your spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities."
