    "text": "Using foul powers of necromancy, you can command undead creatures, making them into your servants.",
    "prerequisites": "Channel negative energy class feature.",
    "benefit": "As a standard action, you can use one of your uses of channel negative energy to enslave undead within 30 feet. Undead receive a Will save to negate the effect. The DC for this Will save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Charisma modifier. Undead that fail their saves fall under your control, obeying your commands to the best of their ability, as if under the effects of <i>control undead<\/i>. Intelligent undead receive a new saving throw each day to resist your command. You can control any number of undead, so long as their total Hit Dice do not exceed your cleric level. If you use channel energy in this way, it has no other effect (it does not heal or harm nearby creatures). If an undead creature is under the control of another creature, you must make an opposed Charisma check whenever your orders conflict.",
    "mythicSource": "Mythic Adventures pg. 61",
    "mythicText": "Your control of the undead is nearly absolute.",
    "mythicPrerequisites": "Command Undead.",
    "mythicBenefit": "When you command undead, the DC of the Will save increases by half your tier, and intelligent undead get no additional saves beyond their first to resist your commands. Any attempts by non-mythic creatures to control undead you command automatically fail, and you gain a +4 bonus on Charisma checks to prevent mythic creatures from stealing control of your undead.",

    "benefit_zh": "以一个标准动作，你可以使用一次引导负能量来命令30尺内的不死生物。不死生物能以意志豁免来抵抗此效果，DC为“10+1/2你的牧师等级+魅力修正”，成功则不受影响。豁免失败的不死生物为你所控制，如同‘命令死灵’法术的效果一样。有智力的不死生物可以每天做一次豁免来抵抗你的命令。你可以控制任意数量的不死生物，只要它们总的HD不超过你的牧师等级。若你以此种方式使用引导能量，它将不会再造成其它效果（即不会治疗或伤害周边的生物）。若不死生物已经为其它生物所支配，当你们的命令相冲突时，你必须以魅力检定进行对抗。",
    "mythicText_zh": "你对死灵的控制力是绝对的。",
    "mythicPrerequisites_zh": "命令死灵",
    "mythicBenefit_zh": "当你使用命令死灵专长时，将你的阶层的一半加到该效果的意志豁免DC上，而且具有智能的不死生物不能在最初对你的命令进行抵抗之后再次获得额外豁免机会。若尝试对你已经控制的不死生物进行控制的生物是非神话生物的话，该尝试自动失败。而且当神话生物尝试对你所控制的不死生物偷取控制权时，你会在防止此行为的魅力检定中获得+4加值。"
