Changing from werebat-kin to bat shape is a standard action. This ability otherwise functions as <i>beast shape II<\/i>, and your ability scores change accordingly.<br><br> If you wear a <i>bat pelt<\/i> (see page 31), you may choose to adopt a form resembling the bat whose skin you wear instead of your normal bat form.",
