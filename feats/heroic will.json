    "benefit": "Once per day as a standard action, you may attempt a new saving throw against a harmful condition requiring a Will save that is affecting you. If you are dominated, controlled, or cannot take an action because of the effect against which you are trying to make a new saving throw, you can make this saving throw at the start of the turn as no action, but on a success, your turn ends. You cannot use this feat to remove instantaneous effects, effects that do not require a Will save, or effects that do not allow a saving throw.",

    "benefit_zh": "每天1次，你能以标准动作对一个正在影响你的、需要意志豁免的有害效果尝试进行一次新的豁免。如果你被支配（dominated）、操纵（controlled）或者无法行动（cannot take an action）而影响你无法尝试重新豁免，你可以无需动作在该轮开始时进行豁免，成功则你的回合结束。你无法以此专长移除立即生效的、不需要进行意志豁免或无法豁免的效果。"
