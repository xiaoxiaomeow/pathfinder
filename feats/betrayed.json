    "descriptors": ["Story"],
    "source": ["Agents of Evil pg. 8"],
    "text": "Believing in a just cause left you with a knife in your back. Now you hoard your trust in others, rarely sharing it.",
    "prerequisites": "You must have had a valuable item (worth at least 1, 000 gp per character level) stolen by a former ally, have been left for dead by a former ally, or have the Wrong Enemy background.",
    "benefit": "When you are in a harmful area of effect created by an ally (through a spell or other means), you can roll your saving throw twice and take the better result. If you do so, your shaken trust means you do not provide flanking bonuses to any allies for 1 hour.",
    "goal": "Track down the people who betrayed you, and either bring them to justice or slay them. At the GM’s discretion, certain members of this group can be spared if they provide important information leading to more prominent targets.",
    "completionBenefit": "You grow more confident in reading others, if not exactly more trusting of them. Your allies and enemies no longer provide cover bonuses on attacks you make against other creatures. You also gain a 20% miss chance against any attacks of opportunity made against you, as long as an ally is threatening the creature making the attack.",
    "name_zh": "遭受背叛",
    "text_zh": "当时相信的事物曾经狠狠地背叛了你，现在的你吝啬对他人的信任，难以相信他人。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "你必须曾经拥有一样宝物(每角色等级1000gp)被你的前盟友盗取，或曾经被他们导致濒死，或拥有“错误对手”角色背景。",
    "benefit_zh": "当你处于盟友所造成的有害区域时（通过法术或其他手段），你可以进行两次检定并取较高的结果。 如果你这样做，你动摇的信任意味着你一小时内你不能为任何盟友提供夹击加值。",
    "goal_zh": "追查出卖你的人，并将他们绳之以法或击杀他们。 根据ＧＭ的判断，（目标团体的）部分成员可以在提供重要的情报来引出更显眼的对象时获得幸免。",
    "completionBenefit_zh": "如果不能确实地相信他人，那就要努力的去理解他们。当你攻击其他生物时，你的盟友和敌人不再提供掩蔽加值。同时只要发动借机攻击的生物处于盟友的威胁范围内，你就能获得20%的失手率在所有针对你的借机攻击。"
