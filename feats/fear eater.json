    "prerequisites": "Cha 13, Iron Will, have no immunity to fear effects.",
    "benefit": "As a standard action, you can remove a fear effect from another creature by touching it. The fear effect is transferred from that creature to you, with the same remaining duration. If the fear effect has varying effects depending on the target (such as the effects of cause fear depending on the target’s Hit Dice), it has the effect it had on the original creature or the effect it would have on you, whichever is more severe. When you choose to accept another creature’s fear, you don’t receive any saving throw, spell resistance, or other defenses you would normally have against the fear effect.",
