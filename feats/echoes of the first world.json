    "prerequisites": "Knowledge (nature) 2 ranks, gnome subtype.",
    "benefit": "While you’re adjacent to an ally who has the gnome subtype and who also has this feat, you gain DR 2/cold iron, and you count as fey instead of humanoid for the purposes of effects that target creatures by type. You still count as having the gnome subtype, however."
