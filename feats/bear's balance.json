    "source": ["The Harrow Handbook pg. 19"],
    "text": "Your anger is always available below the surface, but can be carefully directed. Those who would force you to lose control encounter an unpleasant surprise.",
    "prerequisites": "Iron Will, rage class feature.",
    "benefit": "You gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks when not raging. When you fail a saving throw against a fear effect, you can choose to enter your rage rather than succumb to fear. You can not voluntarily end your rage until the fear effect expires or is ended in some other way (such as due to the death of the fear-inducing creature) or you exhaust your rounds of rage for the day. This feat has no effect if you are already raging when exposed to a fear effect.",

    "name_zh": "熊之平衡",
    "prerequisites_zh": "钢铁意志，狂暴职业特性。",
    "benefit_zh": "未狂暴时，你在威吓检定上获得+2加值。当你对抗恐惧效果的豁免失败，你可以选择进入狂暴从而避免陷入恐惧。在恐惧效果持续时间结束或因其它某些原因终止（比如引起恐惧的生物被干掉了）前，你不能自主结束狂暴，否则将失去当日剩余所有狂暴轮数。但若你在狂暴中遭受恐惧效果，本专长不起作用。"
