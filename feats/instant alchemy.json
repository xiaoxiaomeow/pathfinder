    "prerequisites": "Craft (alchemy) 1 rank.",
    "benefit": "When performing spontaneous alchemy, you can craft an alchemical item as a standard action if its total crafting time is 10 minutes or less and you have all the equipment and materials required in hand. Items that require 1 hour to create with spontaneous alchemy take you only 10 minutes, and items that require 1 day take you only 1 hour. If you have the alchemy class feature, you can identify a potion using the Craft (alchemy) skill as if using <i>detect magic <\/i>as a swift action rather than a standard action."
