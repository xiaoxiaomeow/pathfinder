    "source": ["Ultimate Intrigue pg. 79"],
    "text": "Your bravado convinces your enemies that their deadliest attacks are mere trifles, making you seem nigh invulnerable.",
    "prerequisites": "Cha 13, Bluff 4 ranks.",
    "benefit": "When an opponent confirms a critical hit against you with a melee weapon, you can attempt a special Bluff check against that opponent as an immediate action. The DC of this check is the same as the DC to demoralize the opponent with the Intimidate skill. If you are successful, the attacking opponent is shaken for 1 round as if you had successfully demoralized it with Intimidate. Exceeding the DC by 5 or more does not add to the shaken condition’s duration. If you fail the special Bluff check granted by this feat, you can attempt it against opponents who saw you attempt the earlier check and fail, but you take a –2 cumulative penalty on that Bluff check and any subsequent Bluff checks attempted in conjunction with this feat against those opponents for 24 hours.",

    "text_zh": "你的虚张声势让敌人以为自己做出的猛烈攻击对你来说不值一提，让你看起来毫发无伤。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "魅力 13，唬骗4级。",
    "benefit_zh": "当1名敌人使用近战武器对你确认了重击时，你能够以直觉动作（immediate action）尝试1次特殊的唬骗检定对抗该名敌人。该检定的DC与使用威吓检定挫败士气（demoralize）的DC相同。若你的检定成功，攻击的敌人会颤栗（Shaken）1轮，就好像你成功使用威吓挫败了士气一般。检定结果比DC高5点或更多并不会延长颤栗状态的持续时间。若你在该专长提供的特殊唬骗中失败，则可以尝试用本专长提供的唬骗来对抗那些看到你之前的失败检定的敌人，但是你会在这次的唬骗检定、以及后续24小时内结合本专长对这些敌人做出的唬骗检定中承受累计的-2减值。"
