    "benefit": "You can modify a ray spell to issue from the center of your forehead, where the third eye would be on a yai. This spell doesn’t require somatic components. When the spell is cast, you gain regeneration 1 for a number of rounds equal to the original level of the spell. This regeneration can’t regrow lost body parts or reattach severed limbs. Fire or acid damage suppresses this regeneration for 1 round, which counts against the total duration of the regeneration effect. A yai-mimic spell uses up a spell slot 3 levels higher than the spell’s actual level.",
