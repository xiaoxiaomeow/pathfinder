    "text": "You can imbue curse magic into objects.",
    "benefit": "You can alter a spell with the curse descriptor to target an object rather than a person. Your spell immediately targets the next creature to pick up, handle, or interact with the object as if that creature were the spell’s original target. The curse affects only the first creature to use the item, even if the curse originally affected multiple targets. An object invested with a latent curse detects as magical, with an aura appropriate for the spell’s original level and school. As with all cursed items, someone studying the object’s magic aura recognizes that it is cursed only if her Spellcraft check exceeds the target DC by 10 or more. So long as a latent curse remains active in an item, you cannot recover the spell slot used to cast that spell. A latent curse remains active in an item for 1 day per caster level, but you can dispel the latent curse whenever you recover your spells as a free action, rending the cursed object harmless and regaining the expended spell slot.<br><br> A latent curse spell uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell’s actual level."
