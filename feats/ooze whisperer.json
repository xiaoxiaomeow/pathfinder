    "text": "You have a special bond with slimes and oozes.",
    "prerequisites": "Wild empathy class feature.",
    "benefit": "You may target oozes with spells and special abilities that normally only affect animals as if the oozes were magical beasts with Intelligence 1, though they gain a +4 bonus to their saving throws. You may use wild empathy to influence oozes as easily as you influence magical beasts with Intelligence 1."
