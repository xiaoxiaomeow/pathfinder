    "benefit": "When you use the full-attack action, you can give up your regular attacks and instead make one melee attack at your highest base attack bonus against each opponent within reach. You must make a separate attack roll against each opponent.<br><br>When you use the Whirlwind Attack feat, you also forfeit any bonus or extra attacks granted by other feats, spells, or abilities.",

    "staminaText": "When using this feat, you can spend stamina points to still take bonus or extra attacks granted by other feats, spells, or abilities. You must spend 5 stamina points per extra attack you take in this way. This combat trick allows you to make extra attacks to which you have access—it doesn’t by itself grant extra attacks.",

    "benefit_zh": "当你进行全力攻击时，你可以放弃所有正常攻击，改以最高BAB对攻击范围内所有敌人做一次近战攻击。你必须对每个敌人单独进行一次攻击检定。当使用本专长时，你同时放弃其他专长、法术或能力所赋予你的任何额外攻击次数。",
    "staminaText_zh": "当你使用这个专长时，你可以通过过消耗耐力来打出其他专长，法术，或者能力赋予的额外攻击和加值。对于每次你以这种方式做出的攻击，你都必须消耗5点耐力。该战策允许你做出你能够做出的额外攻击——该专长自身并不能赋予额外的攻击。"
