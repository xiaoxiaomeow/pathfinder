    "source": ["Pathfinder Society Primer pg. 11"],
    "text": "You’re able to discern subtle and ineffable flaws in a creature’s defenses.",
    "prerequisites": "Knowledge (arcana, dungeoneering, local, nature, planes, or religion) 3 ranks.",
    "benefit": "After identifying an individual creature with a successful Knowledge skill check, you can spend a move action to adapt your tactics to reduce that individual’s natural defenses. Choose one of the following abilities that you identified: damage reduction, energy resistance, or spell resistance. For the next 24 hours you treat the selected ability as if it were 2 lower, to a minimum of 0 (for instance, you would treat DR 5/magic as if it were DR 3/magic). You can only benefit from this feat against one single creature at a time. If you use this feat to adapt your tactics to another individual before 24 hours have passed since you last adapted to a creature, the benefit provided against the first individual ends and is replaced by the benefit against the second individual. You can switch which identified creature you have adapted your tactics to (including which special ability you wish to treat as lower) as a move action.",
    "name_zh": "洞悉弱点",
    "text_zh": "你可以洞察一个生物那些细微而隐晦的弱点。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "知识（神秘、地城、本地，自然、位面或者宗教）3级。",
    "benefit_zh": "当你以一个知识检定辨识出一个个体生物后，你可以以一个移动动作调整战术来削弱其防御。选择一个你辨识出的该生物的能力：伤害减免、能量抗性或者法术抗力。在此后的24小时内，你可以视这些能力比正常状况低两点，最低为0（例如你可以视 DR 5/魔法为DR 3/魔法）。同一时间内，你只能利用本专长对一个生物获益。如果你在24小时内将该专长运用于另一个生物，那么专长将对第一个生物失效并对第二个生物生效。只要你成功辨识过多个生物，那么你可以以一个移动动作切换目标（也包括你希望削弱的防御特性）。"
