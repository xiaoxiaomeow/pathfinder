    "benefit": "Your monstrous mount gains the abilities and bonuses listed under Mastery in its stat block. You must be of at least the indicated level for the mount to use these abilities, so if you dismiss a mount and gain a new mount of a different type, you retain the feat but might not yet be of sufficient level for the new mount to gain its Mastery benefits.",

    "benefit_zh": "你的怪物坐骑会获得其属性中标注为“精熟”一栏的能力与加值。你的等级必须至少与该栏标示的等级相同才能使用这些能力，因此如果你遣散一只怪物坐骑并更换不同种的新坐骑的话，尽管你可能会保留该专长，但是你的等级未必足够获取新坐骑的精熟一栏所带来的好处。",
