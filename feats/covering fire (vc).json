    "text": "Your shot can put an enemy off guard, giving your teammates the opportunity to act.",
    "prerequisites": "Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearms), Weapon Focus (at least one firearm).",
    "benefit": "When you hit a foe with a firearm for which you have Weapon Focus, that creature takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls for 1 round against any other ally that also has this feat; this changes to a –4 penalty on attacks of opportunity. The penalty applied by this feat does not stack with itself. However, if both you and an ally with this feat attack the same foe, you can cover each other (since a penalty you impose with this feat doesn’t apply to attacks against you).",
