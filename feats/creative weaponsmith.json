    "text": "You can temporarily customize your own weapons.",
    "prerequisites": "Craft (weapons) 3 ranks, Knowledge (engineering) 3 ranks.",
    "benefit": "With an hour of work, you can temporarily add a weapon modification of your choice to your weapon (or temporarily remove an existing modification) at no cost. You must have access to masterwork artisanâ€™s tools designed for weaponsmithing to perform this alteration. This alteration lasts for 8 hours. Weapon modifications you add this way only provide their benefits to you; any other wielder treats the weapon as one category more difficult to use than normal, but does not gain its benefits."
