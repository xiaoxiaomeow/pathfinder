    "text": "You keep your opponent on the defensive as you circle around threateningly.",
    "prerequisites": "Dex 13, Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack, base attack bonus +6.",
    "benefit": "When you are adjacent to a foe, as a full-round action, you can take a full-attack action to make melee attacks against the foe, moving 5 feet before each attack. You must move 5 feet before each melee attack you make, and can’t exceed your maximum speed, exceed your maximum number of attacks in a round, or attack any other target until the beginning of your next turn. You must remain adjacent to the foe, and your movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal unless you succeed at the appropriate Acrobatics checks. If your first attack against the foe hits, you are considered to be flanking the foe on your second attack. Subsequent attacks made as part of the full-attack action continue to be treated as if you were flanking the foe until one of your attacks misses, at which point your attacks are treated normally.",
    "normal": "A character without this feat is limited to only one 5-foot step during a full attack, taken before, after, or between attacks.",

    "benefit_zh": "当你邻接一个敌人时，以一个全回合动作，你可以对目标进行近战全回合攻击，并在每一次攻击前移动5尺。你必须在每一次攻击前移动5尺，总和不得移动超过自己最大速度，攻击次数无法超过自己一轮攻击次数，且在下一轮开始前无法攻击其它目标。你必须保持邻接该敌人，并且若不通过适当的特技检定，这种移动会正常引发借机攻击。若你的第一击命中目标，则第二击视为夹击目标。只要在该全回合攻击中的后续攻击都没有丢失，则都视为夹击目标。一旦攻击丢失，后续攻击则不再视为夹击。",
    "normal_zh": "一名没有该专长的角色仅能在全回合攻击开始、之后或之间进行1次5尺快步。"
