    "text": "Escaping death strengthened your bond to life, but fills you with a need for answers.",
    "prerequisites": "You must have been slain and brought back from the dead, or have the Left to Die or Cursed Birth background.",
    "benefit": "You don’t die until your negative hit point total is equal to or greater than 4 + your Constitution score. Once per day as a standard action, you can force yourself to carry on by strength of will alone, gaining 1 temporary hit point per hit die. These temporary hit points last for 10 minutes.",
    "normal": "You die when your negative hit point total is equal to or greater than your Constitution score.",
    "goal": "You meet in person and hear the words of your deity or your deity’s chosen herald. If you worship a pantheon of deities, you must meet and hear a member of that pantheon—a herald does not suffice in this case. If you worship no specific deity, you must hear the words of an appropriate entity of the GM’s choice.",
    "completionBenefit": "You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against death effects and fear effects. In addition, the caster level of any conjuration (healing) spell that is cast on you increases by 1 for the purposes of its effects on you alone.",

    "text_zh": "逃脱死亡强化了你的生命联结，但也令你必须追寻一个答案。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "你必须被杀害后复活；或拥有“生即待死（Left to Die）”或“降生诅咒（Cursed Birth）”角色背景。",
    "benefit_zh": "你在生命负值达到“4+体质属性”以上时才会死亡。每日1次，你能够通过标准动作聚集意志力来驱动自己，获得等同HD点数的临时HP。这些临时生命持续10分钟。",
    "normal_zh": "你在生命负值达到“体质属性”时死亡。",
    "goal_zh": "你亲眼见到所信奉的神祇、或其选定的使者，并亲耳听到其教诲。若你崇拜一个神系，你必须见到和听到其中的一员——此种情况下一位使者并不能代劳。若你并无信仰，你必须根据GM的指示得到一位适当的特别存在的教诲。",
    "completionBenefit_zh": "你在对抗死亡和恐惧效果的豁免时获得+2加值。此外，任何作用于你的咒法系（医疗子学派）法术视为CL提高1级，只对你本人有效。"
