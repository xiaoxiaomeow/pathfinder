    "text": "You can increase the range of your spells.",
    "benefit": "You can alter a spell with a range of close, medium, or long to increase its range by 100%. An enlarged spell with a range of close now has a range of 50 ft. + 5 ft./level, while medium-range spells have a range of 200 ft. + 20 ft./level and long-range spells have a range of 800 ft. + 80 ft./level. An enlarged spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.<br><br>Spells whose ranges are not defined by distance, as well as spells whose ranges are not close, medium, or long, do not benefit from this feat.",

    "text_zh": "你可将法术施展得更远。",
    "benefit_zh": "本专长可将近距、中距与远距法术的距离加倍。搭配本专长的近距法术距离为“50尺+5尺/每等级”、中距法术距离为“200尺+20尺/每等级”，而远距法术距离为“800尺+80尺/每等级”。增远的法术须占用高于原本1个环位的法术位。本专长对于与距离无关，或不属于近距、中距、远距的法术没有效果。"
