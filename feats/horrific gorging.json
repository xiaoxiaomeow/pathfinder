    "text": "In the space of a few horrific seconds, you can chew up and gulp down an entire humanoid body.",
    "prerequisites": "Bite attack, Large or larger, swallow whole universal monster ability.",
    "benefit": "As a full-round action, you can completely consume a dead, unconscious, paralyzed, or otherwise helpless humanoid creature that you could normally swallow with your swallow whole ability. When you do, you deal bite damage as a critical hit and swallow the humanoid as your swallow whole special ability.<br><br> Allies of the swallowed creature within 30 feet that can see you indulge in this horrific feast must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) to avoid being shaken for 1d4 rounds. This part of the ability is a mind-affecting fear effect."
