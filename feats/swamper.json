    "text": "The soft ground and flowing reeds of fetid bogs and misty marshes are as comfortable to you as any sunny meadow would be for others.",
    "prerequisites": "Favored terrain (swamp) class feature.",
    "benefit": "You gain a +2 bonus on Climb checks, Swim checks, and Acrobatics checks to maintain your balance when moving across a slippery surface, and you can move at full speed through shallow and deep bog terrain. You can see twice as far as normal in fog, mist, murky water, vegetation, and similarly obscuring conditions, and creatures adjacent to you never gain concealment from fog, mist, murky water, or vegetation."
