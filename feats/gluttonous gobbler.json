    "text": "Some ogres are able to quickly choke down even the largest of meals so they can get on with other business.",
    "prerequisites": "Both Improved Unarmed Strike and Improved Grapple or the grab ability, ogre, size Large or larger.",
    "benefit": "If you start your turn grappling another creature at least two size categories smaller than you, you can put the grappled creature in your mouth as a move action and attempt another grapple combat maneuver check (as though attempting to pin the opponent). If you succeed, you swallow the opponent as if you had the swallow whole special ability.",

    "text_zh": "很多食人魔都学会了如何一口吞下大到吓人的食物，然后抹抹嘴去干别的事。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "精通徒手击打，精通擒抱或抓握特殊攻击，食人魔，体型大型或更大。",
    "benefit_zh": "如果你在自己的回合开始时正擒抱着一个体型至少比你小两级的生物，那么你可以通过一个移动动作，进行另一个擒抱检定尝试把这个生物塞进嘴里（如同你尝试压制这个生物）。如果你成功通过了这个检定，那么你就可以吞掉该生物，如同你拥有囫囵活吞通用怪物能力。"
