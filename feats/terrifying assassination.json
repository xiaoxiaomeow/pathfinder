    "text": "Though no assassin intends to fail at an assassination attempt, you find ways to reduce the severity of failure so you have other chances to kill your targets through protracted combat. Your assassination attempts rattle enemies you fail to kill.",
    "prerequisites": "Assassinate ninja master trick, assassinate slayer advanced talent, or death attack.",
    "benefit": "If you attempt to instantly kill a foe with a death attack, or with the assassinate master trick or advanced talent, and the target doesnâ€™t die, the target is shaken for 2d4 rounds."
