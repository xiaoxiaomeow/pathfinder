    "prerequisites": "Dex 15, Grasping Tail, you must have a tail.",
    "benefit": "You can use your tail for all purposes as though it were a free hand, though you cannot effectively wield weapons or shields with it (you can still carry such objects with your tail, as long as such an object could also be comfortably carried in a hand normally). In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on disarm and steal combat maneuvers and Sleight of Hand checks performed using only your tail, and combat maneuvers performed this way do not provoke attacks of opportunity.",

    "prerequisites_zh": "敏捷 15，贪婪之尾，你必须拥有尾巴。",
    "benefit_zh": "你能使用你的尾巴满足所有目的，如同空手（free hand）一样，但是你不能用他有效地持用武器或盾牌（你仍能用你的尾巴持有物品，只要该物品通常也可以舒适地用手携带）。此外，你在卸武和盗取战技获得+2加值而且不会引起借机攻击，以及在只用你的尾巴的巧手检定获得+2加值。"
