    "prerequisites": "Own at least one room.",
    "benefit": "When a room you own gains the broken condition, you may repair it for half the normal cost in gold pieces and other capital, rounded up (see page 90 of <i>Ultimate Campaign<\/i>). Additionally, buildings and organizations youâ€™ve created are not affected by capital attrition (see page 81 of <i>Ultimate Campaign<\/i>) until 1 month of your absence. From that point, capital attrition affects your buildings and organizations as normal."
