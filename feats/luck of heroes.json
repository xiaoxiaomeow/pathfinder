    "benefit": "Whenever you spend a hero point to reroll a die roll or to grant yourself a bonus before a die roll is made, there is a chance that the hero point is not spent. Whenever you spend a hero point, roll a d20. If the result is greater than 15, the hero point is not spent. You cannot use this feat when you cheat death.",

    "benefit_zh": "当你用英雄点【重整旗鼓（Reroll）】或是在检定前使用【化险为夷（Bonus）】，投一次d20，大于15就能不消耗英雄点。你不能在大难不死时候用这个专长。"
