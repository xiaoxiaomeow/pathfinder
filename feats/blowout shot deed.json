    "text": "By using a specially prepared mix of reagents, you can create concussive blasts with your firearm.",
    "prerequisites": "Craft (alchemy) 3 ranks, grit class feature or Amateur Gunslinger feat.",
    "benefit": "Spend 1 grit point to retrieve a specially prepared dose of black powder from your person. The next time you use the firearm you’ve loaded with this special black powder, the concussive blast knocks you back 5 feet from the direction at which you were aiming. If there is no available space behind you, you brace yourself against the obstacle and do not move from your square. Any creatures within the first range increment of the firearm struck by this attack take damage as normal and must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your gunslinger level + your Int modifier) or be pushed back 10 feet. Creatures within two range increments are pushed back 5 feet, while creatures farther away than this are unaffected by the concussive blast.",

    "benefit_zh": "你消耗1点勇毅点，取出一份你特别准备的黑火药。当你下次使用装填这份特殊黑火药的火器时，你会被冲击波往远离你瞄准方向的方向击退5尺。如果你后方没有可进入的空格，那么你会让自己撞到障碍物上，并且不会移动离开你所在的方格。任何在火器第一射程增量内的生物被此攻击命中的生物，如常受到伤害，并且必须通过反射豁免（DC为10+你枪手等级的一半+你的智力调整值）否则会被推离10尺。在第二射程增量内的生物会被推离5尺，距离更远的生物不受到此冲击波的影响。"
