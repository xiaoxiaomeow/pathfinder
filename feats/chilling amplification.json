    "text": "Your cold spells render their targets sluggish.",
    "benefit": "Whenever you cast a spell with the cold descriptor, you can take a –1 penalty on attack rolls made with the spell and reduce the spell saving throw’s DC by 1 to cause any target that is dealt cold damage by the spell to have its movement speed reduced by 5 feet and become unable to take 5-foot steps. This effect lasts for 1 round + 1 round per 3 spell levels of the spell. You must choose to use this feat before making an attack roll or before your targets attempt their saving throws. This feat has no effect on spells that neither allow a saving throw nor require an attack roll.",

    "benefit_zh": "每当你释放一个带有【寒冷】描述符的法术，你可以选择在该法术攻击骰上承受-1罚值并降低法术豁免DC1，使得任何受到该法术寒冷伤害的目标移动速度减少5尺且无法进行5尺快步。该效果持续【1+每3法术环级1】轮。你必须在进行攻击骰或在你的目标尝试进行豁免骰之前选择是否使用该专长。该专长对那些既不需要攻击骰又不需要进行豁免的法术无效。"
