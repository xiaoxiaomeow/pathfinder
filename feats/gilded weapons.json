    "text": "Axiomatic energies flow from the golden dust you shed, harming chaotic beings on contact.",
    "prerequisites": "Aphorite, crystalline dust racial trait, nonchaotic alignment.",
    "benefit": "As a swift action, you can expend 1 round of your crystalline dust ability to coat up to two of your natural weapons or held manufactured weapons in a layer of crystalline dust. The weapons remain coated for 1 round and deal an additional 1d6 points of damage to creatures with the chaotic subtype. This extra damage does not stack with other features that add alignment-based damage to weapons, such as the <i>axiomatic<\/i> weapon special ability."
