    "prerequisites": "Ability to cast <i>flame blade<\/i> as a spell or spell-like ability.",
    "benefit": "When you cast <i>flame blade<\/i>, you gain a +10 enhancement bonus to your base speed as long as the spell persists, along with a +4 competence bonus on all Acrobatics checks. You add your Charisma modifier to damage rolls with your <i>flame blade<\/i>, and ignore the first 10 points of fire resistance possessed by a creature you hit with the <i>flame blade<\/i> for the purposes of determining the damage dealt by the <i>flame blade<\/i>. Against undead foes, you ignore the first 30 points of fire resistance. Immunity to fire still completely protects against damage from your <i>flame blade<\/i>."
