    "prerequisites": "Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +4.",
    "benefit": "You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). Dazing Fist forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. A foe who fails this saving throw is dazed for 1 round, until just before your next turn. You can attempt to use Dazing Fist once per day for every 4 character levels you have, but no more than once per round. Constructs, incorporeal creatures, plants, undead, and creatures that are immune to critical hits cannot be affected by this ability.",

    "prerequisites_zh": "敏捷13，感知13，精通徒手击打，BAB+4。",
    "benefit_zh": "你必须在投掷攻击骰之前宣告使用此专长（因此，未命中会导致尝试失败）。眩晕拳在正常造成伤害的同时，还会强制受到你徒手击打伤害的敌人进行一次DC=10+1/2你的角色等级+感知调整值的强韧豁免检定。豁免检定失败的防御者将眩晕1轮。每4级你每天可以多尝试一次眩晕攻击，每轮不能超过1次。构装、泥怪、植物、不死、虚体生物，无心智和免疫重击的生物不会被本能力影响。",
    "staminaText_zh": "如果花费5点耐力，你可以在命中后再宣布使用眩晕拳。"
