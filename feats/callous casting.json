    "prerequisites": "Spellcraft 1 rank.",
    "benefit": "You initiate this feat by including an abetting ally in the area of any spell that deals damage of a type to which the abettor is not immune. The callousness of the attack disheartens foes in the area, who must succeed at a Will save against the spell’s DC or be shaken for 1 round per spell level. After you resolve the spell’s effects, the abettor can move up to her speed as an immediate action. Any movement undertaken using this action is then subtracted from her speed until the end of her next turn. This movement can still provoke attacks of opportunity as normal. Once a foe has attempted a Will save against this feat, he is immune to this effect from that initiator for 24 hours thereafter.",

    "benefit_zh": "你可以通过释放一个波及到牺牲者的伤害性法术来激活此专长。牺牲者不能免疫这个法术的伤害类型。<\/p><p>这种丧心病狂的举动会使得法术范围内的敌人失去勇气。他们将颤栗每法术等级1轮除非他们成功的通过了一个DC等同于法术DC的意志检定。当你结算完这个法术的效果之后，牺牲者可以用一个直觉动作移动最高相当于他移动速度的距离。任何以此方式进行的移动都会占用移动者下回合的移动力。这次移动如常提供借机攻击机会。一旦一个敌人因此专长而进行过一次意志豁免，他在接下来24小时免疫同一个行动者使用本专长时产生的效果。"
