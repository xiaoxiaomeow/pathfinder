    "text": "You elicit pity or disgust from your enemies.",
    "benefit": "As a standard action, you can attempt to force an enemy to show you mercy by succeeding at a Diplomacy check (DC = 15 + the target’s Will saving throw bonus) If you succeed, your target’s next successful attack against you deals nonlethal damage (the target does not take the usual attack penalty for dealing nonlethal damage). Whether you succeed or fail, you cannot target the same creature with this feat again for 24 hours."
