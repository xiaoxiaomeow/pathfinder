    "text": "You can convince anyone of her allies’ ill intent.",
    "prerequisites": "Int 13, Combat Expertise, Deceitful Greater Feint, Improved Feint, base attack bonus +6.",
    "benefit": "When you successfully feint in combat, if you succeed by 5 or more, the target no longer provides flanking to its allies and no longer gains or grants the benefits of teamwork feats until the beginning of your next turn. In addition, when you attempt a Bluff check to lie and the lie implies that one or more of the target’s allies have betrayed her or are secretly against her, your lie is one step more believable than normal, from far-fetched to unlikely and from unlikely to believable (if the lie was already less believable than far-fetched, this feat has no effect).",

    "benefit_zh": "当你成功在战斗中使用了虚招时，如果你的检定成功了5点或更多，那么直至你的下个回合为止，目标便不会再为盟友提供夹击，也不会提供或获得团队专长（teamwork feats）带来的好处。<\/p><p>此外，当你尝试1次唬骗检定来说谎，而且谎言中暗指1个或更多个目标的盟友会背叛目标、或者暗中陷害她（secretly against her）的话，该谎言的可信度会比正常情况下高1级，从过于牵强（far-fetched）变为不太可靠（unlikely），从不太可靠（unlikely）变为可信（believable），如果谎言的可信度本身低于过于牵强（far-fetched），则本专长不会产生效果。"
