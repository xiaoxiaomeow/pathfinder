    "benefit": "Select one of the cecaelia focus tattoos below; you gain its benefits while it is active. While you can have any number of focus tattoos, only one can be active at a time. You activate a focus tattoo by concentrating on its importance to you for 1 hour without interruption. Once a focus tattoo is active, it remains so until you activate a new tattoo.<br><br> Each time you would gain a favored class bonus, you may forgo that benefit and instead get another tattoo from the Cecaelia Focus Tattoos list. Instead of getting a new tattoo, you can increase the complexity of an existing tattoo by selecting the same tattoo again. You may choose any tattoo multiple times; if you do, its benefits stack while it is active. <table class=\"inner\"> <tr><td>"
