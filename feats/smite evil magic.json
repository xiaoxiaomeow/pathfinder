    "prerequisites": "Smite evil class feature.",
    "benefit": "You can expend a use of your smite evil class ability to perform a sunder combat maneuver against an ongoing spell effect created by an evil creature. For any effect other than one on a creature, the CMD equals 15 + the effect’s caster level. When sundering an effect on a creature, use the creature’s CMD + 5, ignoring any miss chance caused by a spell or spell-like ability. If successful, you suppress the effect for 1d4+1 rounds. If you exceed the CMD by 10 or more, the effect is dispelled. If an evil outsider, evil dragon, or undead creature created the spell effect, add your Charisma bonus to your combat maneuver check."
