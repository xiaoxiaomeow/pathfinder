    "source": ["Plane-Hopper's Handbook pg. 17"],
    "text": "You might have been a soldier in an army, a self-sacrificing lover, or a hero who rushed in where even angels feared to tread. You died because you valued someone elseâ€™s life above your own.",
    "prerequisites": "Duskwalker.",
    "benefit": "Twice per day, when an ally within 30 feet would die as a result of an attack or failing a saving throw, as an immediate action you can redirect the damage and effects to yourself. This functions as <i>paladin's sacrifice<\/i>. At 11th level, you can use this feat two additional times per day."
